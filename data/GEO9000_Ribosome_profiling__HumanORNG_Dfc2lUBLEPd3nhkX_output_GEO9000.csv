GSE140995	Homo sapiens	12	Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL16791	Multiple links between 5-methylcytosine content of mRNA and translation	2019-11-25	5-methylcytosine (m5C) is a prevalent base modification in tRNA and rRNA but it also occurs more broadly in the transcriptome, including in mRNA. In pursuit of potential links of m5C with mRNA translation, we performed polysome profiling of human HeLa cell lysates and subjected RNA from resultant fractions to efficient bisulfite conversion followed by RNA sequencing (bsRNA-seq). Bioinformatic filters for rigorous site calling were devised to reduce technical noise. We obtained ~1,000 candidate m5C sites in the wider transcriptome, most of which were found in exonic regions of mRNA. Multiple novel sites were validated by amplicon-specific bsRNA-seq in independent samples of either human HeLa, LNCap and PrEC cells. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of either the NSUN2 or TRDMT1 m5C:RNA methyltransferases showed a clear dependence on NSUN2 for the majority of tested sites in mRNA and noncoding RNA. Candidate m5C sites in mRNAs are enriched in 5’UTRs and near start codons, and commonly embedded in a local context reminiscent of the NSUN2-dependent m5C sites found in the variable loop of tRNA. Analysing mRNA sites across the polysome profile revealed that non-conversion levels, at bulk and for many individual sites, were inversely correlated with ribosome association. Altogether, these findings emphasise the major role of NSUN2 in making this mark transcriptome-wide and further substantiate a functional interdependence of cytosine methylation level with mRNA translation	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140995	Multiple links between 5-methylcytosine content of mRNA and translation.

GSE102204	Mus musculus	20	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13112	Transcriptome and translatome profiling from brains of  a mouse model of severe SMA	2017-08-03	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, with an incidence of around 1 in 6,000-10,000 live births. SMA is caused by low levels of full-length survival of motor neuron protein (SMN). Approximately 95% of SMA cases in humans are caused by homozygous deletion of SMN1, with a smaller number caused by discrete mutations within the gene. In concert with other RNA binding proteins, SMN forms complexes both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of neurons. As such, SMN protein has housekeeping roles in the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. In addition, SMN localises to dendrites, synapses and axons in vivo and in vitro, where it is part of messenger RNP (mRNP) complexes with well-known roles in the transport of mRNA. These cellular processes are tightly linked to local translation, suggesting that SMN may play a pivotal role in its regulation. We employed next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and quantify RNAs associated with polysomes (POL-Seq) in parallel with total cytoplasmic RNA (RNA-Seq) in an established mouse model of severe SMA at both early and late-symptomatic stages. This approach enables the simultaneous identification of variations in RNA populations at both translatome (RNAs engagement with polysomes) and transcriptome (steady state cytoplasmic RNAs) levels.

Using selective ribosome profiling, we made the unexpected observation that eIF3 remains bound to post-initiation 80S ribosomes, followed by release after translation of ~50 codons. Furthermore, eIF3 deficiency reduces early ribosomal elongation speed, particularly on mRNAs encoding proteins associated with membrane-associated functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins and abnormal mitochondrial and lysosomal physiology. Accordingly, heterozygous eIF3e+/- knockout mice accumulate giant mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength with age. Hence, in addition to its canonical role in translation initiation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for normal muscle health.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131074	eIF3 Associates with 80S Ribosomes to Promote Translation Elongation, Mitochondrial Homeostasis, and Muscle Health.

However, many tumors escape by activating multiple cellular pathways that induce immunosuppression. One pivotal immune-suppressive mechanism is the production of Tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by IFNγ-induced IDO1 enzyme production. However, phase III clinical trials using chemical inhibition of IDO1 in combination with PD1 pathway blockade failed to improve melanoma treatment, suggesting incomplete understanding of the role of IDO1 and the consequent Tryptophan degradation on mRNA translation and cancer progression. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged IFNγ treatment on mRNA translation in melanoma cells by ribosome profiling. Our results suggest that IFNγ-induced IDO1-mediated Tryptophan depletion may play a key role in the immune recognition of melanoma cells, by inducing the production and presentation of aberrant peptides.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142822	Anti-tumour immunity induces aberrant peptide presentation in melanoma.

How the loss of FMRP alters protein expression and astroglial functions remains essentially unknown. Here we showed that selective loss of astroglial FMRP in vivo up-regulates a brain-enriched miRNA, miR-128-3p, in mouse and human FMRP-deficient astroglia, which suppresses developmental expression of astroglial metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a major receptor in mediating developmental astroglia to neuron communication. Selective in vivo inhibition of miR-128-3p in FMRP-deficient astroglia sufficiently rescues decreased mGluR5 function, while astroglial overexpression of miR-128-3p strongly and selectively diminishes developmental astroglial mGluR5 signaling. Subsequent transcriptome and proteome profiling further suggests that FMRP commonly and preferentially regulates protein expression through posttranscriptional, but not transcriptional, mechanisms in astroglia. Overall, our study defines an FMRP-dependent cell-autonomous miR pathway that selectively alters developmental astroglial mGluR5 signaling, unveiling astroglial molecular mechanisms involved in FXS pathogenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE157723	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA662567	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA662567	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP281862
GSE118215	Arabidopsis thaliana	14	Other	GPL17639	Widespread EJC footprints in the RNA degradome mark mRNA degradation before steady-state translation	2018-08-07	Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited to mRNAs during splicing and displaced from mRNAs by ribosomes in the pioneer round of translation. The understanding of EJC-bound mRNA degradation before steady-state translation has been limited to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) due to a lack of suitable methodologies. Here, we show that RNA degradome data of Arabidopsis, rice, worm and human cells all exhibit a predominant accumulation of 5′ monophosphate (5′P) ends in the canonical EJC region. Inhibition of 5′-3′ exoribonuclease activity and overexpression of an EJC disassembly factor in Arabidopsis reduced the 5′P ends accumulating in the EJC region, supporting the notion that these 5′P ends are in vivo EJC footprints. Hundreds of Arabidopsis NMD targets possess evident EJC footprints, validating their degradation during the pioneer round of translation. In addition to premature termination codons, plant microRNAs can also direct the degradation of EJC-bound mRNAs. However, the production of EJC footprints from NMD but not microRNA targets is dependent on an NMD factor, SMG7. Together, our finding demonstrating in vivo EJC footprinting unravels the composition of the RNA degradome, and provides a new avenue for studying NMD and other mechanisms, such as microRNAs, targeting EJC-bound mRNAs for degradation before steady-state translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118215	Widespread Exon Junction Complex Footprints in the RNA Degradome Mark mRNA Degradation before Steady State Translation.

The PIC component eukaryotic initiation factor 1A (EIF1A), encoded on human chromosomes X and Y by EIF1AX and EIF1AY, respectively, is essential for recruitment of the ternary complex and for assembling the 43S PIC, which after recruitment onto capped mRNAs scans their 5’UTR and localizes the AUG to initiate translation. Recurrent EIF1AX mutations are found in several cancers, including ~1% of papillary thyroid cancers in a mutually exclusive manner with other drivers (BRAF, RAS, and oncogenic fusions). They are enriched in advanced thyroid cancers (11%) where they display a striking co-occurrence with RAS, which we show cooperate to induce tumorigenesis in mouse models and in isogenic cell lines. The C-terminal tail EIF1AX-A113splice mutation is the most prevalent in advanced thyroid cancer, and private to this disease. We found that EIF1AX-A113spl variants stabilize the PIC and induces ATF4 expression, a sensor of cellular stress, which is co-opted to suppress EIF-2α phosphorylation, thus enabling a general increase in protein synthetic rate. RAS stabilizes c-MYC, an effect augmented by EIF1AX-A113spl. ATF4 and c-MYC induce expression of aminoacid transporters, and enhance sensitivity of mTOR to aminoacid supply. These mutually reinforcing events generate therapeutic vulnerabilities to MEK, BRD4 and mTOR kinase inhibitors. The RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling samples provided here were used to support the claim of increased translational efficiency of ATF4.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113695	<i>EIF1AX</i> and <i>RAS</i> Mutations Cooperate to Drive Thyroid Tumorigenesis through ATF4 and c-MYC.

Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are unable to effectively differentiate direct miRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we present a simple approach to deconvolute post-transcriptional and transcriptional changes using PRO-seq with RNA-seq. In combination, these methods allow us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: Combined Analysis of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. We identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the coding region. CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that underlie downstream regulatory changes. Given the robustness of the approach, CARP is particularly suitable for dissecting miRNA regulatory networks in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142895	Robust partitioning of microRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes.

GSE119615	Homo sapiens	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Translation of upstream open reading frames in a model of neuronal differentiation	2018-09-06	Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiate translation within mRNA 5’ leaders,and have the potential to altermain coding sequence(CDS) translationontranscripts in which they reside. Ribosome profiling(RP)studies suggest that translating ribosomes are pervasive within 5’ leadersacross model systems. However, the significance of this observationremains unclear. To explore a role for uORF usage in neuronal differentiation, we performed RP on undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. Using a spectral coherence algorithm (SPECtre),we identify4,954uORFsacross31%of all neuroblastoma transcripts. These uORFspredominantly utilize non-AUG initiationcodonsand exhibit translational efficiencies(TE)comparable to annotated coding regions. Usage of both AUG initiated uORFs and aconservedandconsistently translated subset of non-AUG initiated uORFs correlateswith repressed CDS translation. Ribosomal protein transcripts are enriched in uORFs, and select uORFs on such transcripts were validated for expression. Withneuronal differentiation, we observedan overall positive correlation between translational shifts in uORF/CDSpairs. However,a subset of transcripts exhibit inverse shifts in translation of uORF/CDSpairs. TheseuORFsare enriched in AUG initiation sites, non-overlapping, and shorterin length. Cumulatively, CDSs downstream of uORFs characterized by persistent translation show smaller shifts in TE withneuronal differentiation relative to CDSs without a predicted uORF, suggesting that fluctuations in CDS translation are buffered by uORF translation. In sum, this work provides insights into the dynamic relationshipsand potential regulatory functionsof uORF/CDS pairs in a model of neuronal differentiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119615	Translation of upstream open reading frames in a model of neuronal differentiation.

GSE102315	Homo sapiens	20	Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	Nutritional control of protein translation	2017-08-07	Regulation of protein translation is a key feature of many biological processes. Global protein translation as well as translation at the codon level can be regulated by RNA modifications. These modifications are particularly enriched in tRNAs, where they represent an additional regulatory layer on top of the primary RNA sequence. In eukaryotes, levels of tRNA queuosinylation reflect the bioavailability of the precursor queuine, which is salvaged from the gut microbiota and absorbed in the intestine. We show here that reduced queuine supply results in a strong reduction of tRNA queuosinylation in various cultured human cell lines and mouse tissues. In addition, Dnmt2-dependent tRNA methylation is dynamically modulated by the presence or absence of queuine. Ribosome profiling showed that nutritionally determined queuosine-tRNA (Q-tRNA) levels control the translation speed of Q-tRNA decoded codons. Dysregulation of translation resulted in pronounced endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, which could be rescued by the addition of queuine. Together, these findings establish a direct link between nutrient availability and the decoding of the transcriptome, thus providing a new perspective in our understanding of translational regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102315	Queuosine-modified tRNAs confer nutritional control of protein translation.

GSE123608	Homo sapiens	8	Other	GPL20301	Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells [tRNA sequencing]	2018-12-11	The uneven use of synonymous codons in the transcriptome regulates the efficiency and fidelity of protein translation rates. Yet, the importance of this codon bias on regulating cell state-specific expression programs is currently debated. Here, we asked whether the gene expression program in the well-defined cell states of self-renewal and differentiation in embryonic stem cells is driven by optimized codon usage. Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identified distinct codon signatures for human self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. One driver for the cell state-specific codon bias was the genomic GC-content of the differentially expressed genes and thus, determined by transcription rather than translation. However, by measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome’s active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we discovered that the wobble position tRNA modification inosine strongly influenced the codon optimization in self-renewing embryonic stem cells. This effect was conserved in mice and independent of the differentiation stimulus. In summary, we newly reveal how translational mechanisms based on RNA modifications can shape optimized codon usage in embryonic stem cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123608	Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.

GSE77033	Homo sapiens	1	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	nanoCAGE reveals 5’ UTR features that define specific modes of translation of functionally related mTOR-sensitive mRNAs	2016-01-20	mTOR regulates mRNA translation. Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that mTOR exclusively stimulates translation of TOP (containing a 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine [5’TOP] motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling implied that mTOR also modulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. We show that ribosome-, but not polysome-profiling, is biased towards identification of TOP mRNAs as differentially translated while obscuring detection of changes in non-TOP mRNA translation. Transcription start site profiling by Nano-Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that many mTOR-sensitive mRNAs do not have 5’TOP motifs. Moreover, nanoCAGE showed that 5’ UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of mTOR-sensitive mRNAs: i) those with short 5’ UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions such as respiration, that are translated in an eIF4E, but not eIF4A1-dependent manner and ii) mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, that harbor long 5’ UTRs, and require both eIF4E and eIF4A1 for their efficient translation. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5’ UTRs via suppression of eIF4A leads to uncoupling of expression of proteins involved in respiration (e.g. ATP5O) from those protecting mitochondrial integrity (e.g. BCL-2) ultimately resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous translational downregulation of both long and short 5’ UTR mRNAs by mTOR inhibitors results in suppression of mitochondrial respiration and predominantly cytostatic effects. Therefore, 5’ UTR features define differential modes of translation of functionally distinct mTOR-sensitive mRNAs, which explains discrepancies between the effects of mTOR and eIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77033	nanoCAGE reveals 5' UTR features that define specific modes of translation of functionally related MTOR-sensitive mRNAs.

Regulators of translation and ribosomal proteins were prominent among these, and expression of RPL15, a component of the large ribosome subunit, was sufficient to increase metastatic growth in multiple organs. RPL15 overexpression selectively increases translation of other ribosomal proteins and cell cycle regulators. Unsupervised analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing of freshly-isolated CTCs from breast cancer patients identifies a subset with strong ribosomal and protein translation signatures, correlated with increased proliferative markers, epithelial markers and poor clinical outcome. Thus, ribosome protein expression identifies an aggressive subset of CTCs, whose therapeutic targeting may suppress metastatic progression.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143623	Deregulation of ribosomal protein expression and translation promotes breast cancer metastasis.

As such, tumor cells must acquire enhanced ribosome production. How many of the mutations in tumor cells ultimately achieve this aberrant production is largely unknown. The gene encoding ARF is the most commonly deleted gene in human cancer. ARF plays a significant role in regulating ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing, ribosome export into the cytoplasm, and global protein synthesis. Utilizing ribosome profiling, we show that 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation is upregulated following loss of ARF. Genes with increased translational efficiency following loss of ARF include many ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Knockout of p53 largely phenocopies ARF loss, with increased protein synthesis and expression of 5’-TOP encoded proteins. The 5’-TOP regulators eIF4G1 and LARP1 are upregulated in ARF and p53 null cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE156749	Upregulation of 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA translation upon loss of the ARF tumor suppressor.

This early diverging eukaryote shows many novel features in basic biological processes, including the use of polycistronic transcription to generate all protein-coding mRNAs. Therefore we hypothesized that translational control provides a means to tune gene expression during parasite development in mammalian and fly hosts. We used ribosome profiling to examine genome-wide protein production in animal-derived slender bloodstream forms and cultured procyclic (insect midgut) forms. About one-third of all CDSs showed statistically significant regulation of protein production between the two stages. Of these, more than two-thirds showed a change in translation efficiency, but few were controlled by this parameter alone. Ribosomal proteins were translated poorly, especially in animal-derived parasites. A disproportionate number of metabolic enzymes were up-regulated at the mRNA level in procyclic forms, as were variant surface glycoproteins in bloodstream forms. Comparison with cultured bloodstream forms from another strain identified stage-specific changes in protein production that transcend strain and growth conditions. Genes with upstream ORFs had a lower mean translation efficiency but no evidence was seen for involvement of these ORFs in stage-regulation. Ribosome profiling revealed that differences in the production of specific proteins in T. brucei slender bloodstream and procyclic forms are more common than anticipated from analysis of mRNA abundance. While in vivo and in vitro derived slender bloodstream forms of different strains are more similar to one another than to procyclic forms, they showed numerous differences at both the mRNA and protein production level.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57336	Extensive stage-regulation of translation revealed by ribosome profiling of Trypanosoma brucei.

GSE77180	Homo sapiens	8	Expression profiling by array	GPL5175	Translational reprogramming of colorectal cancer cells induced by 5-fluorouracil through a miRNA-dependent mechanism	2016-01-25	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in colorectal cancer. Previous studies showed that 5-FU modulates RNA metabolism and mRNA expression. In addition, it has been reported that 5-FU incorporates into the RNAs constituting the translational machinery and that 5-FU affects the amount of some mRNAs associated with ribosomes. However, the impact of 5-FU on translational regulation remains unclear. Using translatome profiling, we report that a clinically relevant dose of 5-FU induces a translational reprogramming in colorectal cancer cell lines. Comparison of mRNA distribution between polysomal and non-polysomal fractions in response to 5-FU treatment using microarray quantification identified 313 genes whose translation was selectively regulated. These regulations were mostly stimulatory (91%). Among these genes, we showed that 5-FU increases the mRNA translation of HIVEP2, which encodes a transcription factor whose translation in normal condition is known to be inhibited by mir-155. In response to 5-FU, the expression of mir-155 decreases thus stimulating the translation of HIVEP2 mRNA. Interestingly, the 5-FU-induced increase in specific mRNA translation was associated with reduction of global protein synthesis. Altogether, these findings indicate that 5-FU promotes a translational reprogramming leading to the increased translation of a subset of mRNAs that involves at least for some of them, miRNA-dependent mechanisms. This study supports a still poorly evaluated role of translational control in drug response.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77180	Translational reprogramming of colorectal cancer cells induced by 5-fluorouracil through a miRNA-dependent mechanism.

In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5' UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause-relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhanced upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript where this resulted in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced usage of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons. Thus, we propose that eIF5A functions not only to maintain efficient translation elongation in eukaryotic cells, but also to maintain the fidelity of translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132007	Suppression of Ribosomal Pausing by eIF5A Is Necessary to Maintain the Fidelity of Start Codon Selection.

The interior of the ribosome exit tunnel is neither straight nor smooth. How the ribosome dynamics in vivo is influenced by the exit tunnel is poorly understood. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in mammalian cells reveals elevated ribosome density at the start codon and surprisingly the downstream 5th codon position as well. We found that the highly focused ribosomal pausing shortly after initiation is attributed to the geometry of the exit tunnel, as deletion of the loop region from ribosome protein L4 diminishes translational pausing at the 5th codon position. Unexpectedly, the ribosome variant undergoes translational abandonment shortly after initiation, suggesting that there exists an obligatory step between initiation and elongation commitment. We propose that the post-initiation pausing of ribosomes represents an inherent signature of the translation machinery to ensure productive translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE166874	Ribosome profiling reveals sequence-independent post-initiation pausing as a signature of translation.

The mechanism of anemia involves an impaired differentiation and increased apoptosis of erythroblasts. Here we show that GATA1 protein expression is low in line with a defect in the representation of its mRNA at the ribosome. A global analysis of transcripts on polysomes indicates that translation is selective with a decreased representation of the transcripts with a short coding sequence and UTRs and a highly structured 3’UTR, a subset of transcripts that includes GATA1. Our whole proteome analysis confirms that post-transcriptionally downregulated proteins were encoded by transcripts with a short length and structured 3’UTR. We identified a subset of post-translationally downregulated proteins including ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors encoded by 5’TOP mRNAs that were enriched on the ribosome. Our results indicate that the thermodynamic characteristics of 3’UTR and in a lesser extend 5’UTR and the transcript length are the determinants of translation selectivity under RPS14 haploinsufficiency conditions and that a post-translational regulation of ribosomal proteins accounts for their decreased content in the cell.

GSE51584	Homo sapiens	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL9115; GPL11154	Expanded identification and characterization of mammalian circular RNAs	2013-10-23	The recent reports of two circular RNAs (circRNAs) with strong potential to act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges suggest that circRNAs might play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the global properties of circRNAs are not well understood. We developed a computational pipeline to identify circRNAs and quantify their relative abundance from RNA-seq data. Applying this pipeline to a large set of non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project, we annotated 7,112 human circRNAs that were estimated to comprise at least 10% of the transcripts accumulating from their loci. Most circRNAs are expressed in only a few cell types and at low abundance, but they are no more cell-type–specific than are mRNAs with similar overall expression levels. Although most circRNAs overlap protein-coding sequences, ribosome profiling provides no evidence for their translation. We also annotated 635 mouse circRNAs, and although 20% of them are orthologous to human circRNAs, the sequence conservation of these circRNA orthologs is no higher than that of their flanking linear exons. The previously proposed miR-7 sponge, CDR1as, is one of only two circRNAs with more miRNA sites than expected by chance, with the next best miRNA-sponge candidate deriving from a primate-specific zinc-finger gene, ZNF91. These results provide a new framework for future investigation of this intriguing topological isoform while raising doubts regarding a biological function of most circRNAs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51584	Expanded identification and characterization of mammalian circular RNAs.

Differentiation is brought about by global changes to chromatin architecture and transcriptional networks, yet whether other regulatory events support cell fate determination is less well understood. Using human embryonic stem cell and Xenopus models, we identified the vertebrate-specific ubiquitin ligase Cul3KBTBD8 as an essential regulator of neural crest specification. Cul3KBTBD8 monoubiquitylates NOLC1 and its paralog TCOF1, whose mutation underlies the craniofacial disorder Treacher Collins Syndrome that is characterized by a loss of cranial neural crest cells. Ubiquitylation of NOLC1 and TCOF1 drives formation of a platform that connects RNA polymerase I with ribosome modification enzymes, thereby altering the translational program of differentiating cells to support the generation of neural crest cells. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of ribosome function is an important feature of cell fate determination.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62247	Cell-fate determination by ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translation.

Despite miRNAs’ crucial role in various cellular processes and disease states, the identification of their targets remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are inadequate in differentiating direct targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we introduce a simple approach involving combined analysis of RNA-seq and Precise RunOn-seq (PRO-seq) (CARP) to effectively measure post-transcriptional regulation. We apply this approach to seven different miRNAs and robustly distinguish their direct targets from downstream changes. We validate the efficacy of our approach using argonaute-CLIP-seq. We show using CARP and ribosome-profiling analyses that accelerated mRNA decay is the major mode of target regulation by miRNAs. Additionally, our comparative analyses reveal that CARP aids in discovery of complex regulatory mechanisms and in capturing false-negatives of existing approaches. Furthermore, post-transcriptional changes measured using CARP uncover miRNA-dependent regulation of coding sites. Lastly, we demonstrate that PRO-seq provides mechanistic explanation of indirect targeting, unraveling miRNA regulatory networks. Finally, we believe that CARP is particularly suitable to study in vivo functions of miRNAs in primary cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140366	Robust partitioning of microRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes.

In contrast to previous reports based on studies of human cancer cell lines, almost all methylation sites were close to fully methylated in adult tissues. A subset of sites was differentially modified in developing tissues compared to their adult counterparts and showed clear developmental dynamics. This provides the first evidence for ribosome heterogeneity at the level of rRNA modifications during mouse development. In a prominent example, the expression levels of SNORD78 during development appeared to be regulated by alternative splicing of the Gas5 host-gene and to correlate with the methylation level of its target site at LSU-G4593.

Method: Here we describe a novel interplay between RBPsLIN28B and IMP1 in intestinal epithelial cells. Ribosome-profiling and RNA-sequencing identifies IMP1 as a principle nodefor gene expression regulation downstream of LIN28B. Results: In vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that epithelial IMP1 loss increases expression of WNT target genes and enhances LIN28B-mediated intestinal tumorigenesis, which was reversed when we overexpressed IMP1 independently in vivo. Furthermore, IMP1 loss in wild type or LIN28B-overexpressing mice enhancesthe regenerative response to irradiation.

We performed an unbiased next-generation RNA-sequencing approach to identify commonalities or differences of the effect of HIV, HCV and HBV viremia on NK cell transcriptomes. Methods: Using cell sorting, we obtained CD3-CD56+ NK cells from blood of 6 HIV, 11 HCV, and 32 HBV infected and untreated patients.

Results: In NK cells from HIV, HCV and HBV patients, transcriptome analysis identified 272, 53, and 56 differentially expressed genes, respectively (fold change >1.5, q-value 0.2). Interferon stimulated genes were induced in NK cells from HIV/HCV patients, but not during HBV infection. HIV viremia downregulated ribosome assembly genes in NK cells. In HBV, viral load and ALT variation had little effect on genes related to NK effector function. Conclusion: We compare, for the first time, NK cell transcripts of viremic HIV, HCV and HBV patients.

Studies of the genetic forms of PD have helped to reveal disease mechanisms. Functional interactions between some Parkinson's disease (PD) genes, like PINK1 and parkin, have been identified, but whether other ones interact remains elusive. Here we report an unexpected genetic interaction between two PD genes, VPS35 and EIF4G1. We provide evidence that EIF4G1 upregulation causes defects associated with protein misfolding. Expression of a sortilin protein rescues these defects, downstream of VPS35, suggesting a potential role for sortilins in PD. We also show interactions between VPS35, EIF4G1 and alpha-synuclein, a protein with a key role in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD. We extend our findings from yeast to an animal model and show these interactions are conserved in neurons. We also connect VPS35 impairments to neurodegeneration in alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Our studies reveal unexpected genetic and functional interactions between two seemingly unrelated PD genes and functionally connect them to alpha-synuclein pathobiology in yeast, worms, and mouse.

Additionally, DDX3 variants also shift ORF usage on select genes, such as RPLP1 and stress-response factors as an added mechanism of translation regulation during stress.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles.

Here we simulate the translational deregulation found in cancer by ectopically over expressing translation initiation factor eIF4E in primary human mammary epithelial cells; and examine its impact on cell biology and the pattern of ribosomal recruitment to mRNA genome wide. Over expression of eIF4E allows cells to bypass M0 premature growth arrest, but does not confer other malignant properties. However, in concert with hTERT, eIF4E imparts cells with growth and survival autonomy - and profoundly alters the pattern of polyribosome-associated mRNA encoding cell cycle and apoptosis regulators. The translational response to increased eIF4E is not only a unidirectional activation of oncogenic drivers, but also consists of complex intrinsic translational mechanisms that mitigate the acquisition of neoplastic properties.

This is believed to be due to the unwinding of secondary structures within the 5’UTRs of oncogenic mRNAs, with studies showing that in general eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have longer 5’UTRs with more stable secondary structures, yet our ability to predict eIF4A-dependency from 5’UTR properties alone remains poor. We therefore used Structure-seq 2 to measure transcriptome-wide changes in RNA structure in MCF7 cells, following eIF4A inhibition with hippuristanol. This technique measures the single-strandedness of RNA by specific and rapid methylation of single-stranded adenosines and cytosines with Dimethyl Sulphate (DMS). When paired with polysome profiling data to identify which mRNAs are most translationally repressed, we can identify the structural determinants of eIF4A-dependency. Upon eIF4A inhibition, both 5’UTRs and CDSs become generally more structured, while overall this was not observed for 3’UTRs. This was most pronounced in CDSs, supporting recent findings that the ribosome sculpts RNA structure in this region. 5’UTRs are generally more structured at their 5’ ends and highly translated mRNAs are less structured just upstream of the CDS. Following eIF4A inhibition, the 5’UTR is remodelled. eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have greater localised gains of structure. The degree of these structural changes is strongly correlated with 5’UTR length, explaining why eIF4A-dependent mRNAs have longer 5’UTRs. Crucially, in eIF4A-dependent mRNAs these highly-structured elements are located predominantly at the 3’ end of the 5’UTR, suggesting that increased structure just upstream of the CDS is most inhibitory to translation following eIF4A inhibition and is a key determinant of eIF4A-dependency.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134865	mRNA structural elements immediately upstream of the start codon dictate dependence upon eIF4A helicase activity.

Using yeast genetics and genome-wide ribosome profiling analyses we show that this mechanism, initially derived from studies of the Brome Mosaic virus RNA genome, extends to yeast and human mRNAs highly enriched in membrane and secreted proteins. All Dhh1-dependent mRNAs, viral and cellular, share key common features. First, they contain long and highly structured CDSs, including a region located around nucleotide 70 after the translation initiation site, second, they are directly bound by Dhh1 with a specific binding distribution and third, complementary experimental approaches suggest that they are activated by Dhh1 at the translation initiation step.

Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138640	Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576651	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576651	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224954

While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes. Here, we combined ribosome and tRNA profiling to investigate the relations between ribosome elongation rates, (aminoacyl-) tRNA levels and codon usage in mammals. We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids. While translation fluxes varied significantly across diurnal time and feeding regimen, codon dwell times were highly stable, and conserved in human. Fasting had no effect on codon dwell times in mouse liver. Profiling of total and aminoacylated tRNAs revealed highly heterogeneous levels with specific isoacceptor patterns and a correlation with codon usage. tRNAs for isoleucine, asparagine, aspartate and arginine were lowly loaded and conserved in fasted mice. Finally, codons with low levels of charged tRNAs and high codon usage relative to tRNA abundance exhibited long dwell times. Together, these analyses pave the way towards understanding the complex relation between tRNA loading, codon usage and ribosome dwell times in mammals.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126382	Robust landscapes of ribosome dwell times and aminoacyl-tRNAs in response to nutrient stress in liver.

IMP1 (IGF2 mRNA Binding Protein 1) is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and Imp1 hypomorphic mice exhibit severe gut growth defects. In the present study, we investigated the mechanistic contribution of intestinal epithelial IMP1 to gut homeostasis and response to injury. Method: We evaluated IMP1 expression in patients with Crohn’s disease followed by unbiased ribosome profiling in IMP1 knockout cells. Concurrently, we measured differences in histology and cytokine expression in mice with intestinal epithelial-specific Imp1 deletion (Imp1ΔIEC) following dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- colitis. Based on ribosome profiling analysis, we evaluated changes in autophagy in Imp1ΔIEC mice as well as in silico and in vitro approaches to evaluate direct protein:RNA interactions. Finally, we analyzed the consequence of genetic deletion of Atg7 in Imp1ΔIEC mice using colitis and irradiation models. Results: IMP1 was robustly upregulated in Crohn’s disease patients and Imp1 loss lessened DSS-colitis severity. Unbiased ribosome-profiling revealed that IMP1 may coordinate translation of multiple pathways important for intestinal homeostasis, including cell cycle and autophagy, which we verified by Western blotting. Mechanistically, we observed evidence for increased autophagy flux in Imp1ΔIEC mice, reinforced through in silico and biochemical analyses revealing direct binding of IMP1 to autophagy transcripts. Finally, we found genetic deletion of Atg7 reversed the phenotype observed in DSS- or irradiation-challenged Imp1ΔIEC mice. Conclusions: IMP1 acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of gut epithelial repair, in part through modulation of autophagy. This study highlights the need for examining post-transcriptional regulation as a critical mechanism in inflammatory bowel disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112305	Posttranscriptional regulation of colonic epithelial repair by RNA binding protein IMP1/IGF2BP1.

Based on the combination of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis, as well as polysome profiling, we identified a subset of mRNAs translationally regulated by BRCA1 and coding for proteins whose functions play major role in cancer. We found that the level of these key proteins is similarly controlled in human mammary tumors according to their BRCA1-status.

Here, we show that TMBIM6 is closely associated with survival in patients with cervical, breast, lung, and prostate cancer. TMBIM6 deletion or knockdown suppressed primary tumor growth. Further, mTORC2 activation was up-regulated by TMBIM6 and stimulated glycolysis, protein synthesis, and the expression of lipid synthesis genes and glycosylated proteins. Moreover, ER-leaky Ca2+ from TMBIM6, a unique characteristic, was shown to affect mTORC2 assembly and its association with ribosomes. In addition, we identified that BIA compound, a suggestive TMBIM6 antagonist, prevented TMBIM6 binding to mTORC2, decreased mTORC2 activity, and also regulated TMBIM6-leaky Ca2+, further suppressing tumor formation and progression in cancer xenograft models. This previously unknown signaling cascade in which mTORC2 activity is enhanced via the interaction with TMBIM6 provides effective therapeutic targets for various malignancies.

It remains unclear how cells maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, which is critical for maintaining iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis, an indispensable function of mitochondria.

Extensive omics analyses of these mutants show that accompanying mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, these mutants progressively activate adaptive responses, including transcriptional downregulation of ATP synthase inhibitor Inh1 and OXPHOS subunits, Puf3-mediated upregulation of import receptor Mia40 and global mitochondrial biogenesis, Snf1/AMPK-mediated upregulation of glycolysis and repression of ribosome biogenesis, and transcriptional upregulation of cytoplasmic chaperones.

As part of their antiviral response, cells also trigger the translational shutoff response which prevents translation of viral mRNAs and cellular mRNAs in a non-selective manner. Intriguingly, mRNAs encoding for antiviral factors bypass this translational shutoff, suggesting the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms enabling expression of the self-defence genes. Here, we identified the dsRNA binding protein ILF3 as an essential host factor required for efficient translation of the central antiviral cytokine, IFNB1, and a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. By combining polysome profiling and next-generation sequencing, ILF3 was also found to be necessary to establish the dsRNA-induced transcriptional and translational programs. We propose a central role for the host factor ILF3 in enhancing expression of the antiviral defence mRNAs in cellular conditions where cap-dependent translation is compromised. In this dataset we use polysome profiling in combination with RNA-seq to investigate the effect of ILF3 on the translation of mRNAs in HeLa cells in homeostasis and the antiviral response.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130742	ILF3 contributes to the establishment of the antiviral type I interferon program.

N1-methyladenosine (m1A) is a recently identified mRNA modification; however, little is known about its precise location, regulation and function. Here, we develop a single-nucleotide resolution m1A profiling method, based on m1A-induced misincorporation during reverse transcription, and report distinct classes of m1A methylome in the human transcriptome. m1A in the 5’-untranslated region, particularly those located exactly at the first nucleotide of mRNA transcripts, associates with increased translation efficiency. A different subset of m1A sites exhibit a GUUCRA tRNA-like motif, are evenly distributed in the transcriptome and are dependent on the methyltransferase complex TRMT6/61A. Additionally, we show for the first time that m1A is prevalent in the mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Manipulation of m1A level via TRMT61B, a mitochondria-localizing m1A methyltransferase, demonstrates that m1A in mitochondrial mRNA interferes with translation. Collectively, our approaches reveal distinct classes of m1A methylome and provide a resource for functional studies of m1A-mediated epitranscriptomic regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102040	Base-Resolution Mapping Reveals Distinct m<sup>1</sup>A Methylome in Nuclear- and Mitochondrial-Encoded Transcripts.

We recently reported a novel human phenotype resulting from a mutation in the critical coding region of the HBS1L gene characterized by facial dysmorphism, severe growth restriction, axial hypotonia, global developmental delay and retinal pigmentary deposits. Here we further characterize downstream effects of the human HBS1L mutation. HBS1L has three transcripts in humans, and RT-PCR demonstrated reduced mRNA levels corresponding with transcripts V1 and V2 whereas V3 expression was unchanged. Western blot analyses revealed HBS1L protein was absent in proband samples. Additionally, polysome profiling revealed an abnormal aggregation of 80S monosomes in patient cells under baseline conditions. RNASeq data corresponded to the patient phenotype, with biological process analysis showing skeletal system development and sensory development genes being most altered between patient and controls. Ribosomal sequencing demonstrated an increased translation efficiency of ribosomal RNA in Hbs1L-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that there may be a compensatory increase in ribosome translation to accommodate the increased 80S monosome peak. Furthermore, lack of Hbs1L caused depletion of Pelota protein in both patient cells and mouse tissues, while PELO mRNA levels were unaffected. Inhibition of proteasomal function partially restored Pelota expression in human Hbs1L-deficient cells.

GSE99909	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Polysome-profiling in small tissue samples - proof of concept experiment for the use of an optimized non linear gradient	2017-06-12	Polysome-profiling is commonly used to study translatomes, i.e. transcriptome-wide patterns of translational efficiency. The standard approach for collecting efficiently translated polysome-associated RNA results in laborious extraction of RNA from a large volume across many fractions. This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts such as primary cells or frozen tissues. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for mRNAs associated with >3 ribosomes in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10 fold. The technique can be applied to frozen tissue samples from biobanks, and generates polysome-associated RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material. When coupled with smart-seq2, a single-cell RNA sequencing technique, translatomes from small tissue samples can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved HCT-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associated with changes in mRNA abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in mRNA levels are buffered at the level of mRNA translation to maintain protein levels constant. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in bio banks.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99909	Polysome-profiling in small tissue samples.

However, the functional significance of eEF1Amethylation remains obscure and it has remained unclear whether eEF1A methylation is dynamic and subject to active regulation. We here demonstrate, using a wide range of in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the previously uncharacterized human methyltransferase METTL21B specifically targets Lys-165 in eEF1A in an aminoacyl-tRNA- and GTP-dependent manner. Interestingly, METTL21B mediated eEF1A methylation showed strong variation across different tissues and cell lines, and was induced by altering growth conditions or by treatment with certain ER-stress-inducing drugs, concomitant with an increase in METTL21B gene expression. Moreover, genetic ablation of METTL21B function in mammalian cells caused substantial alterations in mRNA translation, as measured by ribosome profiling. A non-canonical function for eEF1A in organization of the cellular cytoskeleton has been reported, and interestingly, METTL21B accumulated in centrosomes, in addition to the expected cytosolic localization. In summary, the present study identifies METTL21B as the enzyme responsible for methylation of eEF1A on Lys-165 and shows that this modification is dynamic, inducible and likely of regulatory importance.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE93133	The novel lysine specific methyltransferase METTL21B affects mRNA translation through inducible and dynamic methylation of Lys-165 in human eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A).

GSE65999	Homo sapiens	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	The contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome	2015-02-17	Alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes. Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles, and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins. We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling and proteomics data from human tissues and cell lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site selectivity of ADARB1 protein products. Our data indicate that Alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences during primate and human evolution.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65999	The contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome.

Alteration of miR-1271-5p induced considerable changes to mRNA abundance and translation which spanned a diverse range of cellular functions, including directly targeted genes strongly associated with cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular junctions. Mechanistic analyses additionally revealed that upregulation of miR-1271-5p predominantly repressed mRNAs through destabilisation, wherein 3´UTR and CDS binding sites exhibited similar efficacy. Knockdown, however, produced no discernible trend in target gene expression and strikingly resulted in increased expression of the highly conserved miR-96-5p which shares an identical seed region with miR-1271-5p, suggesting the presence of feedback mechanisms which sense disruptions to miRNA levels. These findings indicate that while bidirectional regulation of miR-1271-5p results in substantial remodelling of the neuronal transcriptome, these effects are not inverse in nature. In addition, we provide further support for the idea that destabilisation of mRNA is the predominant mechanism by which miRNAs regulate complementary mRNAs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148827	Characterising the Transcriptional and Translational Impact of the Schizophrenia-Associated miR-1271-5p in Neuronal Cells.

It is believed that chronic infection alters host gene expression and favours HCC development. In particular, HCV replication in Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) derived membranes induces chronic ER stress. How HCV replication affects host mRNA translation and transcription at a genome wide level is not yet known. Methods: We used Riboseq (Ribosome Profiling) to analyze transcriptome and translatome changes in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells replicating HCV for 6 days. Results: Established viral replication does not cause global changes in host gene expression - only around 30 genes are differentially expressed. Upregulated genes are related to ER stress, HCV replication and HCC development. Some mRNAs (PPP1R15A/GADD34, DDIT3/CHOP, TRIB3) may be subject to uORF mediated translation control in response to stress-induced eIF2 inactivation. Transcriptional downregulation mainly affects mitochondrial respiratory chain complex genes. Conclusion: After establishing HCV replication, cellular gene expression is reprogrammed towards stress response and HCC development. Downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes indicates how a virus induces cancer cell-like metabolic reprogramming (""Warburg effect""). Thus, HCV escapes stress response pathways but induces selective gene expression changes which likely are beneficial for chronic infection and cancerogenesis."	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127713	Cellular Gene Expression during Hepatitis C Virus Replication as Revealed by Ribosome Profiling.

These mutations are in the factors involved in splice site selection, including a missense mutation (Ser34Phe) in a conserved nucleic acid binding domain of the spicing factor U2AF1. This protein plays a critical role in recognition of the 3'-splice site and assembly of the pre-spliceosomal complex. However, the role that this mutation plays in oncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we have uncovered a non-canonical function of U2AF1. PAR-CLIP and RIP data show that U2AF1 directly binds mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and that binding on or near the start codon results in translational repression. This splicing-independent translational regulatory role of U2AF1 is altered by the S34F mutation, leading to elevated translation of hundreds of mRNA, as revealed by polysome profiling.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126912	The splicing factor U2AF1 contributes to cancer progression through a noncanonical role in translation regulation.

However, how widespread this remodeling is and whether structural changes can serve as additional regulatory steps for other regulators remains under-explored. Here, we assayed RNA structural dynamics, gene expression, translation and decay during different stages of human neuronal differentiation to understand the impact of RNA structures in stem cell regulation. RBP binding resulted in wide-spread RNA structure changes during early neuronal differentiation. Structure changes act as a common mechanism for RBPs to modulate the binding of additional RBPs and miRNAs to coordinate gene expression temporally. In particular, we showed that PUM2 binding on LIN28A resulted in RNA structure changes that enabled miR-30 binding, leading to downregulation of LIN28A. Compensatory mutagenesis experiments that lock specific structural states confirmed the importance of PUM2-induced structure changes in miR-30 regulation. This systematic study broadens our understanding of RNA structural dynamics during human neuronal differentiation and illustrates the wide-spread and complex role of RBPs in regulating RNA structures for gene regulation during human development.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE156671	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA658654	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA658654	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP278460
GSE31539	Homo sapiens	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13393	Ribosome footprinting in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum	2011-08-19	In eukaryotic cells, the spatial regulation of protein expression is frequently conferred through the coupling of mRNA localization and the local control of translation. mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a prominent example of such regulation and serves a ubiquitous role in segregating the synthesis of secretory and integral membrane proteins to the ER. Recent genomic and biochemical studies have now expanded this view to suggest a role for the ER in global protein synthesis. We have utilized cell fractionation and ribosome profiling to obtain a genomic survey of the subcellular organization of mRNA translation and report that ribosomal loading of mRNAs, a proxy for mRNA translation, is biased to the ER. Notably, ER-associated mRNAs encoding both cytosolic and topogenic signal-encoding proteins display similar ribosome loading densities, suggesting that ER-associated ribosomes serve a global role in mRNA translation. We propose that the partitioning of mRNAs and their translation between the cytosol and ER compartments may represent a novel mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE31539	Primary role for endoplasmic reticulum-bound ribosomes in cellular translation identified by ribosome profiling.

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (≥84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22002	Mammalian microRNAs predominantly act to decrease target mRNA levels.

Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors corrected translational alterations but not transcriptional dysfunction.

We hypothesized that lung stromal cells activate pathological gene expression programs supporting oncogenesis. To identify molecular mechanisms operating in the lung stroma that support development of lung cancer. Study subjects included patients with- or without- lung cancer across a spectrum of lung function. We conducted multi-omics analysis of non-malignant lung tissue to quantify the transcriptome, translatome and proteome. Cancer-associated gene expression changes predominantly manifested as alterations in the efficiency of mRNA translation modulating protein levels in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA levels. The molecular mechanisms driving these cancer-associated translation programs differed based on lung function. In subjects with normal to mildly impaired lung-function, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway served as an upstream driver; whereas in severe airflow obstruction, pathways downstream of pathological extracellular matrix (ECM) emerged. Consistent with a role during cancer initiation, both the mTOR and ECM gene expression programs paralleled activation of previously identified pro-cancer secretomes. Furthermore, in situ examination of lung tissue documented that stromal fibroblasts express cancer-associated proteins from the two pro-cancer secretomes including IL6 in mild or no airflow obstruction and BMP1 in severe airflow obstruction. Two distinct stromal gene expression programs promoting cancer initiation are activated in lung cancer patients depending on lung function.

The global post-transcriptional mechanisms underlying fibroblast-to-myofibroblast conversion in the heart have not been explored. Methods: Genome-wide changes of RNA transcription and translation during human cardiac fibroblast activation were monitored with RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. We then used a RNA-binding protein-based analyses to identify translational regulators of fibrogenic genes. The integration with cardiac ribosome occupancy levels of 30 dilated cardiomyopathy patients demonstrates that these post-transcriptional mechanisms are also active in the diseased fibrotic human heart. Results: We generated nucleotide-resolution translatome data during the TGFβ1-driven cellular transition of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. This identified dynamic changes of RNA transcription and translation at several time points during the fibrotic response, revealing transient and early-responder genes. Remarkably, about one-third of all changes in gene expression in activated fibroblasts are subject to translational regulation and dynamic variation in ribosome occupancy affects protein abundance independent of RNA levels. Targets of RNA-binding proteins were strongly enriched in post-transcriptionally regulated genes, suggesting genes such as MBNL2 can act as translational activators or repressors. Ribosome occupancy in the hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy suggested the same post-transcriptional regulatory network was underlying cardiac fibrosis. Key network hubs include RNA-binding proteins such as PUM2 and QKI that work in concert to regulate the translation of target transcripts in human diseased hearts. Furthermore, silencing of both PUM2 and QKI inhibits the transition of fibroblasts toward pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts in response to TGFβ1. Conclusions: We reveal widespread translational effects of TGFβ1 and define novel post-transcriptional regulatory networks that control the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. These networks are active in human heart disease and silencing of hub genes limits fibroblast activation. Our findings show the central importance of translational control in fibrosis and highlight novel pathogenic mechanisms in heart failure.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131111	Widespread Translational Control of Fibrosis in the Human Heart by RNA-Binding Proteins.

Measures of transcriptional mRNA levels may therefore misrepresent cellular activation. To test this hypothesis employing human physiological mRNA levels, we analyzed cytoplasmic and polyribosome-bound mRNA expression (Frac-seq) combined with microRNA profiling by small RNA-seq in bronchoepithelial cells from healthy and severe asthma (SA) donors, SA being a chronic inflammatory airways disease, poorly understood at the molecular level. We found 275 genes bound to polyribosomes differentially between healthy and severe asthma, of which only 11.64% overlapped with differentially expressed cytoplasmic mRNAs (226 genes). We found 335 alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms differentially bound to polyribosomes of which only ~8% were revealed by cytoplasmic mRNA analysis. Approximately two thirds of differentially expressed isoforms could not be found at the gene level in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound fractions, demonstrating the disruption of splicing in asthma. Only the analysis of differentially expressed isoforms bound to polyribosomes revealed disease-related pathways overlooked in total mRNA. We detected a network of 21 microRNAs differentially expressed, with 8 microRNAs accounting for more than 80% targeting observed in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNA isoforms. Importantly, microRNAs target distinct cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNAs.

Features in transmembrane domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important, but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding. Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature proteasomal degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112891	The ER membrane protein complex interacts cotranslationally to enable biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37018	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.37018}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA449388	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA449388	None
GSE143263	Homo sapiens	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573	Thousands of novel unannotated proteins expand the MHC I immunopeptidome in cancer	2020-01-07	Tumor epitopes – peptides that are presented on surface-bound MHC I proteins - provide targets for cancer immunotherapy and have been identified extensively in the annotated protein-coding regions of the genome. Motivated by the recent discovery of translated novel unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs) using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we hypothesized that cancer-associated processes could generate nuORFs that can serve as a new source of tumor antigens that harbor somatic mutations or show tumor-specific expression. To identify cancer-specific nuORFs, we generated Ribo-seq profiles for 29 malignant and healthy samples. These included primary normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, patient-derived primary glioblastoma (GBM) and melanoma cell cultures, primary healthy melanocytes, as well as established colon carcinoma and melanoma cell lines. These also included B721.221 cells, the parental cell line previously used to generate 92 single HLA allele-expressing lines from which we collected mono-allelic MHC I immunopeptidome data. We developed a hierarchical approach to identify translated novel unannotated open reading frames that leverages the large amount of Ribo-seq data we have generated in order to uncover lowly expressed nuORFs, while also preserving tissue specificity. We constructed a database of novel unannotated ORFs (nuORFdb) and used it to analyze mass spectrometry datasets of MHC I-bound peptides, where we detected peptides from 3,555 nuORFs. Additionally, we used nuORFdb to identify cancer-specific nuORFs, as well as nuORFs harboring cancer-specific somatic variants as potential sources of neoantigens in cancer. *This repository contains data from the publicly available cell lines used in this study, including B721.221 cells, A375 cells, HCT116 cells and primary healthy melanocytes (Thermo C0025C).

Mehods: We apply high-throughput sequencing of ribosome footprints (ribosome profiling) and poly(A) RNA (RNA sequencing) in an isogenic pair of transformed (tamoxifen-treated) and non-transformed (ethanol control) MCF10A-ER-Src cells subjected to the metabolic stresses that differentially affect global protein synthesis (Figure 1): deprivation of glutamine (for 30min and 4 hours), glucose (4hours), cysteine/cystine (4hours) or leucine/isoleucine/valine (brach-chain aminoacids - BCAA) (4hours). The same experiments were also performed in transformed ER-Src MCF10A treated with torin1 (500nM) for 4 hours. Results: Genome-wide translational profiling of glutamine deprived ER-Src MCF10A cells (for 30 minutes) shows increased translation of uORFs-containing mRNAs and down-regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, which is followed by increased translation and transcription of cytokine and inflammatory mRNAs (after 4 hours of glutamine deprivation). The transcription and translation of inflammatory and cytokine mRNAs is also stimulated in response to 4 hours deprivation of glucose, cysteine/cystine and BCAA, with the extent of stimulation correlating with the i) decrease in global protein synthesis and ii) down-regulation of all translationally-repressed mRNAs or ribosomal protein mRNAs. Conclusions: Pro-inflammatory gene expression is associated with translational repression in response to short-term nutrient deprivation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE114794	Nutrient Deprivation Elicits a Transcriptional and Translational Inflammatory Response Coupled to Decreased Protein Synthesis.

While gene regulation is a multi-step process, the majority of research concerning divergence in gene regulation among primates has focused on transcription. To gain a comprehensive view of gene regulation, we surveyed genome-wide ribosome occupancy, which reflects levels of protein translation, in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. We further integrated mRNA and protein level measurements collected from matching cell lines. We find that, in addition to transcriptional regulation, the major factor determining protein level divergence between human and closely related species is post-translational buffering. Inter-species divergence in transcription is generally propagated to the level of protein translation. In contrast, gene expression divergence is often attenuated post-translationally, potentially mediated through post-translational modifications. Results from our analysis indicate that post-translational buffering is a conserved mechanism that led to relaxation of selective constraint on transcript levels in humans.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71808	Post-translational buffering leads to convergent protein expression levels between primates.

GSE14000	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by array	GPL570	Fine-tuning of human dendritic cells regulation revealed by translational profiling	2008-12-16	Dendritic cells (DCs) are the sentinels of the mammalian immune system and they undergo a complex maturation process mediated by activation upon pathogen detection. Recent studies described the analysis of activated DCs by transcriptional profiling, but translation regulation was never taken in account. Therefore, the nature of the mRNAs being translated at various stages of DC activation was determined with the help of translational profiling, which is the sucrose gradient fractionation of polysomal-bound mRNAs combined to microarrays analysis. Total and polysomal-bound mRNA populations were compared in immature (0h) and LPS-stimulated (4h and 16h) human monocyte-derived DCs with the help of Affymetrix microarrays. Biostatistical analysis indicated that 296 mRNA molecules are translationally regulated during DC-activation. The most abundant biological process among the regulated mRNAs was protein biosynthesis, indicating the existence of a negative feedback loop regulating translation. Interestingly, a cluster of 17 ribosomal proteins were part of the regulated mRNAs, indicating that translation may be fine-tuned by particular components of the translational machinery. Our observations highlight the importance of translation regulation during the immune response, and may favour the identification of novel gene clusters or protein networks relevant for immunity. Our study also provides information on the possible absence of correlation between gene expression and real protein production in DCs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14000	Ribosomal protein mRNAs are translationally-regulated during human dendritic cells activation by LPS.

Here we combine SLAM-seq, a novel method for direct quantification of newly synthesized mRNAs, with pharmacological and rapid chemical-genetic perturbation to interrogate primary transcriptional targets of BRD4 and MYC and define the response to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). While BRD4 acts as a global co-activator of Pol2-dependent transcription in a BET bromodomain-dependent manner, therapeutic BETi doses deregulate a small set of hypersensitive target genes. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator that controls basic metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de-novo purine synthesis across diverse cancer contexts. Beyond defining primary regulatory functions of BRD4 and MYC in cancer, our study establishes a simple, robust and scalable approach to dissect direct transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100708	SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis.

Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138641	Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576652	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576652	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224955

An essential part of this technology is removal of unwanted, normally abundant, ribosomal RNA sequences in order to save on sequencing costs. The most effective commercial solution (Ribo-Zero) has been discontinued and a number of new, experimentally distinct commercial applications have emerged on the market. Here we evaluated several commercially available alternatives designed for RNA-seq of human samples and find them unsuitable for ribosome footprint profiling. We instead recommend the use of custom-designed biotinylated oligos, which were widely used in early ribosome profiling studies. Importantly, we warn that depletion solutions based on targeted nuclease cleavage significantly perturb the high-resolution information that can be derived from the data, and thus do not recommend their use for any applications that require precise determination of the ends of RNA fragments.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147324	Nuclease-mediated depletion biases in ribosome footprint profiling libraries.

Although certain risk factors such as smoking status and histology are known, our ability to predict oral cancer risk remains poor. The study objective was to determine the value of gene expression profiling in predicting oral cancer development. Gene expression profile was measured in 86 of 162 OPL patients who were enrolled in a clinical chemoprevention trial that used the incidence of oral cancer development as a prespecified endpoint. The median follow-up time was 6.08 years and 35 of the 86 patients developed oral cancer over the course. Gene expression profiles were associated with oral cancer-free survival and used to develope multivariate predictive models for oral cancer prediction. We developed a 29-transcript predictive model which showed marked improvement in terms of prediction accuracy (with 8% predicting error rate) over the models using previously known clinico-pathological risk factors. Based on the gene expression profile data, we also identified 2182 transcripts significantly associated with oral cancer risk associated genes (P-value<0.01, single variate Cox proportional hazards model). Functional pathway analysis revealed proteasome machinery, MYC, and ribosomes components as the top gene sets associated with oral cancer risk. In multiple independent datasets, the expression profiles of the genes can differentiate head and neck cancer from normal mucosa. Our results show that gene expression profiles may improve the prediction of oral cancer risk in OPL patients and the significant genes identified may serve as potential targets for oral cancer chemoprevention.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE26549	Gene expression profiling predicts the development of oral cancer.

GSE144163	Homo sapiens	4	Other	GPL18573	Ribosome profiling of ABCE1-knockout cells	2020-01-23	Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a pathway that degrades messenger RNAs containing premature termination codons. Here, a genome-wide screen for NMD factors uncovered an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen revealed that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which in turn is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway converges on the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in the movement of ribosomes into 3ʹ UTRs where they displace exon junction complexes, thereby abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3ʹ UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Due to the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3ʹ UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144163	Ribosome Recycling by ABCE1 Links Lysosomal Function and Iron Homeostasis to 3' UTR-Directed Regulation and Nonsense-Mediated Decay.

GSE89629	Mus musculus	6	Expression profiling by array	GPL6887	The thrombopoietin/MPL axis is activated in the Gata1 low mouse model of myelofibrosis and is associated with a defective RPS14 signature [spleen]	2016-11-07	Myelofibrosis (MF) is caused by genetic abnormalities involving the thrombopoietin (TPO)/MPL/JAK2 axis. Furthermore MF patients have elevated serum TPO levels. MF is also associated with reduced GATA1 content in MK suggesting that this abnormality represents a phenotypic modifier. In 2014, Dr. Crispino suggested that in MF abnormal TPO signaling induces a ribosomal deficiency hampering GATA1 mRNA translation in MK. Support for MK GATA1 deficiency as “phenotypic modifier” in MF was provided by the observation that mice carrying the Gata1low mutation reducing Gata1 transcription in MK develop myelofibrosis. Since reduced RBC half-life subject these mice to continuous “erythroid stress”, we investigated the TPO/Mpl axis in this model. In Gata1low and wild-type mice, TPO mRNA was expressed by bone marrow (BM), spleen and liver. The greatest expression (by 300-fold) was detected in liver. Gata1low livers expressed TPO mRNA levels 6-fold greater than wild-type livers. TPO protein was detected in BM, spleen, liver and peritoneum washes and plasma. The greatest levels where detected in plasma. Gata1low plasma contained TPO levels 2-fold lower than wild-type plasma, but 2-times greater than plasma from bleed wild-type mice and Mplnull mice with similar thrombocytopenia, suggesting that TPO is overproduced in Gata1low mice. JAK2 and STAT5 were easily detected in Gata1low BM bur barely detectable in wild-type BM, suggesting that in the former MPL is prompt to signaling activation. Furthermore, Gata1low LSK expressed levels of Mpl mRNA 3-times greater than wild-type cells but expressed cell-surface levels of MPL 2-times lower than wild-type cells and similar to those on LSK from TPO-treated wild-type mice, suggesting that MPL is down-modulated in Gata1low LSK. The Crispino’s hypothesis that in MF activation of TPO/MPL/JAK2 induces a ribosomal deficiency hampering GATA1 mRNA translation and the realization that this axis is activated in Gata1low mice made us question the original hypothesis that reduced content of GATA1 in Gata1low MK results from deletion of lineage-specific enhancers. Microarray analyses indeed identified that Gata1low BM express a discordant ribosome signature including reduced expression of RPS24 and RPS36A, two genes mutated in Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a disease characterized by inefficient GATA1 mRNA translation. Electron microscopy identified that the cytoplasm of Gata1low MK contained poorly developed endoplasmic reticulum with rare polysomes. In conclusion, these results validate the Gata1low model as a MF model by indicating that these mice express an activated TPO/MPL axis and an abnormal ribosomal signature which may reduce efficiency of Gata1 mRNA translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89629	The thrombopoietin/MPL axis is activated in the Gata1<sup>low</sup> mouse model of myelofibrosis and is associated with a defective RPS14 signature.

Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138639	Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576650	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576650	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224953

Its central assumption is that ribosome footprint density on a transcript quantitatively reflects protein synthesis. Here, we test this assumption using pulsed-SILAC (pSILAC) high-accuracy targeted proteomics. We focus on multiple myeloma cells exposed to bortezomib, a first-line chemotherapy and proteasome inhibitor. In the absence of drug effects, we found that direct measurement of protein synthesis by pSILAC correlated well with indirect measurement of synthesis from ribosome footprint density. This correlation, however, broke down under bortezomib-induced stress. By developing a statistical model integrating longitudinal proteomic and mRNA-seq measurements, we found that proteomics could directly detect global alterations in translational rate caused by bortezomib; these changes are not detectable by ribosomal profiling alone. Further, by incorporating pSILAC data into a gene expression model, we predict cell-stress specific proteome remodeling events. These results demonstrate that pSILAC provides an important complement to ribosome profiling in measuring proteome dynamics.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69047	Time-Resolved Proteomics Extends Ribosome Profiling-Based Measurements of Protein Synthesis Dynamics.

Methods: High-resolution gene expression profiles of embryonic endothelial cells (EC) using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and single cell RNA-sequencing. RNA-sequenzing of transcription factor infected HUVEC. Results: Comparisons of different organ-, temporal- or Ctnnb1 knock out-specific vascular translatomes revealed extensive molecular changes during the unique development of the brain endothelium. We identified brain endothelial-specific transcription factors – Foxf2, Foxl2, Foxq1, Lef1, Ppard, Zfp551 and Zic3 – that are associated with the temporal maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling pathway. Profiling individual EC revealed a remarkable heterogeneity. Nevertheless, high levels of Foxf2, Foxq1, Ppard and Zic3 were correlated with elevated expression of differentiation markers. This could be recapitulated in vitro, where expression of Foxf2 and Zic3 in HUVEC led to an induction of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers. Conclusions: Our study provides further insights into the temporal and cellular complexity of the developing embryonic brain endothelium. Our data raises many questions and provides a basis for further studies aiming to unravel cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie vascular development and differentiation in the CNS. We anticipate that additional investigation of the identified transcription factors is likely to be a fruitful approach in understanding and manipulating the development of BBB and to engineer more advanced blood brain barrier in vitro models.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79306	Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels.

Consistent with previous reports, RNA structures are dominant features for STAU1 binding to CDSs and 3ʹUTRs. Overall, relative to short 3ʹUTR counterparts, longer 3ʹUTR isoforms of genes have stronger STAU1 binding, most likely due to a higher frequency of RNA structures, including specialized IRAlus. However, a sizable fraction of genes express transcripts showing the opposite trend, attributable to AU-rich sequences in their alternative 3'UTRs, possibly recruiting antagonistic RBPs and/or destabilizing STAU1-binding RNA structures. Using STAU1-knockout cells, we show that strong STAU1 binding to mRNA 3'UTRs generally enhances polysome association. However, IRAlus have little impact on STAU1-mediated polysome association despite having strong interactions with the protein.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148771	3'READS + RIP defines differential Staufen1 binding to alternative 3'UTR isoforms and reveals structures and sequence motifs influencing binding and polysome association.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71891	AKT Inhibition Promotes Nonautonomous Cancer Cell Survival.

Here we report the ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells and brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs), which leads to the identification of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) as a CSC- specific determinant. We confirmed that GPD1 is expressed in BTSCs but not in neural stem cells. Intriguingly, expression of GPD1 is only found in the infiltrating dormant BTSCs in vivo and these cells start to divide and drive tumour relapse after chemotherapy. Most importantly, inhibition of GPD1 expression in tumour-bearing mice leads to prolonged survival. Further analysis shows that loss of GPD1 results in widespread changes in important pathways affecting BTSC maintenance. Human patient data analysis suggests that GPD1 is expressed in the dormant infiltrating tumour cells in human glioblastoma and the expression level is associated with a worse prognosis.

The mechanism of anemia involves an impaired differentiation and increased apoptosis of erythroblasts. Here we show that GATA1 protein expression is low in line with a defect in the representation of its mRNA at the ribosome. A global analysis of transcripts on polysomes indicates that translation is selective with a decreased representation of the transcripts with a short coding sequence and UTRs and a highly structured 3’UTR, a subset of transcripts that includes GATA1.

To obtain a genome-wide perspective of the effects of radiation on gene translation, microarray analysis was done on polysome-bound RNA isolated from irradiated human brain tumor cells; to allow for a comparison with the effects of radiation on transcription, microarray analysis was also done using total RNA. The number of genes whose translational activity was modified by radiation was f10-fold greater than those whose transcription was affected. The radiation-induced change in a gene’s translational activity was shown to involve the recruitment of existing mRNAs to and away from polysomes. Moreover, the change in a gene’s translational activity after irradiation correlated with changes in the level of its corresponding protein. These data suggest that radiation modifies gene expression primarily at the level of translation. In contrast to transcriptional changes, there was considerable overlap in the genes affected at the translational level among brain tumor cell lines and normal astrocytes. Thus, the radiation-induced translational control of a subset of mRNAs seems to be a fundamental component of cellular radioresponse.

Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the erythroid-specific hematopoietic defects observed in DBA, only recently has the role of selectively impaired translation been highlighted in these phenotypes. Exactly how and to what extent this impairment of translation occurs is currently unknown. Here, by identifying a novel DBA gene affecting ribosome biogenesis, we show that both RPH and impaired ribosome biogenesis (IRB) limit the availability of actively translating ribosomes, resulting in the hematopoietic and translational defects observed in DBA. Our results show that the selective impairment of translation is due to a quantitative defect, where ribosomes of invariant protein composition have a reduced abundance, rather than a qualitative defect, where a subset of ribosomes lack specific ribosomal proteins (RPs) and thus may have altered translational capacity. In RPH, we find that cellular RP homeostasis is largely maintained through translational co-regulation, and we identify a selective subset of transcripts that have impaired association with the ribosome. Surprisingly, these transcripts have short and unstructured 5’ UTRs and are highly abundant and efficiently translated in healthy human erythroid progenitors, suggesting that the impaired translation of a number of key transcripts, including GATA1, may underlie DBA. Overall, our study identifies mechanisms by which RPH and IRB affect mRNA translation, illuminating how these alterations can result in cell-type specific defects and cause human disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89183	Ribosome Levels Selectively Regulate Translation and Lineage Commitment in Human Hematopoiesis.

Ribo-Seq is based on sequencing all the ribosome protected mRNA fragments in a cell, while PUNCH-P is based on mass-spectrometric analysis of only newly synthesized proteins. Here we describe the first Ribo-Seq/PUNCH-P comparison via the analysis of mammalian cells during the cell-cycle for detecting relevant differentially expressed genes between G1 and M phase. Our analyses suggest that the two approaches significantly overlap with each other. However, we demonstrate that there are biologically meaningful proteins/genes that can be detected to be post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle only by each of the approaches, or their consolidation. Such gene sets are enriched with proteins known to be related to intra-cellular signalling pathways such as central cell cycle processes, central gene expression regulation processes, processes related to chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and replication, that are post-transcriptionally regulated during the mammalian cell cycle. Moreover, we show that combining the approaches better predicts steady state changes in protein abundance. The results reported here support the conjecture that for gaining a full post-transcriptional regulation picture one should integrate the two approaches.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE73565	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA297338	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA297338	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP064313

Using selective ribosome profiling, we made the unexpected observation that eIF3 remains bound to post-initiation 80S ribosomes, followed by release after translation of ~50 codons. Furthermore, eIF3 deficiency reduces early ribosomal elongation speed, particularly on mRNAs encoding proteins associated with membrane-associated functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins and abnormal mitochondrial and lysosomal physiology. Accordingly, heterozygous eIF3e+/- knockout mice accumulate giant mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength with age. Hence, in addition to its canonical role in translation initiation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes to enhance, at the level of early elongation, the synthesis of proteins with membrane-associated functions, an activity that is critical for normal muscle health.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149697	eIF3 Associates with 80S Ribosomes to Promote Translation Elongation, Mitochondrial Homeostasis, and Muscle Health.

Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-seq) maps the positions of translating ribosomes over the entire transcriptome.

Understanding all of its aspects requires substantial technological advancements. Here we modified yeast Translational Complex Profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adopted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ses) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ses), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ses distribute similarly across 5’UTRs indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed a variation called Selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq) enabling selection for 40Ses and 80Ses associated with an immuno-targeted factor in yeast and human. Sel- TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5’UTRs with scanning 40Ses to successively dissociate upon start codon recognition. Manifesting the Sel-TCP-seq versatility for gene expression studies, we also identified four initiating 48S conformational intermediates, provided novel insights into ATF4 and GCN4 mRNA translational control, and demonstrated co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139131	Selective Translation Complex Profiling Reveals Staged Initiation and Co-translational Assembly of Initiation Factor Complexes.

Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3′ UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145722	Genome-wide Survey of Ribosome Collision.

Regulators of translation and ribosomal proteins were prominent among these, and expression of RPL15, a component of the large ribosome subunit, was sufficient to increase metastatic growth in multiple organs. RPL15 overexpression selectively increases translation of other ribosomal proteins and cell cycle regulators. Unsupervised analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing of freshly-isolated CTCs from breast cancer patients identifies a subset with strong ribosomal and protein translation signatures, correlated with increased proliferative markers, epithelial markers and poor clinical outcome. Thus, ribosome protein expression identifies an aggressive subset of CTCs, whose therapeutic targeting may suppress metastatic progression.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143624	Deregulation of ribosomal protein expression and translation promotes breast cancer metastasis.

Yet, the importance of this codon bias on regulating cell state-specific expression programs is currently debated. Here, we asked whether the gene expression program in the well-defined cell states of self-renewal and differentiation in embryonic stem cells is driven by optimized codon usage. Using ribosome and transcriptome profiling, we identified distinct codon signatures for human self-renewing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. One driver for the cell state-specific codon bias was the genomic GC-content of the differentially expressed genes and thus, determined by transcription rather than translation. However, by measuring the codon frequencies at the ribosome’s active sites interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNA), we discovered that the wobble position tRNA modification inosine strongly influenced the codon optimization in self-renewing embryonic stem cells. This effect was conserved in mice and independent of the differentiation stimulus. In summary, we newly reveal how translational mechanisms based on RNA modifications can shape optimized codon usage in embryonic stem cells.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112085	Codon usage optimization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.

In this study, we developed a new feasible method measuring poly(A)-tail length called TED-seq and applied it to investigate the change of mRNA's poly(A)-tail lengths in ER stress pharmacologically induced by thapsigargin (THAP). Combined with other global RNA analyses such as RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and PRO-seq, we observed that ER stress induced lenthening poly(A)-tail length, in particular of ER-stress-regulators, upon ER stress. More specifically, these mRNAs are translationally de-repressed and more stabilized based on increase in poly(A)-tail length. We also identified that insoluble fractions which include stress-induced RNA-granules have overall shorter length of poly(A) tail.

Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52809	Poly(A)-tail profiling reveals an embryonic switch in translational control.

Rapamycin analogs selectively inhibit mTORC1, but fail to suppress phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1, a translational repressor that is a key driver of oncogenic mTORC1 signaling. mTOR kinase active-site inhibitors fully suppress mTORC1 and phosphorylation of its substrates, but are active against mTORC2 and additional kinases, potentially contributing to tolerability limitations. The prototype bi-steric inhibitor RapaLink-1 exploits the selective mTORC1 interactions of rapamycin and the broad mTOR kinase inhibitory effects of an active-site inhibitor, through covalent linkage of the two pharmacophores to achieve complete mTORC1/2 inhibition. We demonstrate that the anti-proliferative activity of RapaLink-1 is dependent upon mTORC1 and suppression of 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Using a rational design strategy, we tuned the affinities of the rapamycin core and ATP-mimetic moieties to create novel bi-steric inhibitors with enhanced mTORC1 selectivity and potency against 4EBP1 phosphorylation. mTORC1-selective bi-steric compounds produced durable inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, and drove tumor regressions at well-tolerated doses in xenograft models of breast cancer.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138417	Selective inhibitors of mTORC1 activate 4EBP1 and suppress tumor growth.

GSE49716	Homo sapiens	2	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL15520	A long noncoding RNA protects the heart from pathological hypertrophy	2013-08-10	The role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in adult hearts is unknown; also unclear is how lncRNA modulates nucleosome remodelling. An estimated 70% of mouse genes undergo antisense transcription1, including myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7), which encodes molecular motor proteins for heart contraction2. Here we identify a cluster of lncRNA transcripts from Myh7 loci and demonstrate a new lncRNA–chromatin mechanism for heart failure. In mice, these transcripts, which we named myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts (Mhrt), are cardiac-specific and abundant in adult hearts. Pathological stress activates the Brg1–Hdac–Parp chromatin repressor complex3 to inhibit Mhrt transcription in the heart. Such stress-induced Mhrt repression is essential for cardiomyopathy to develop: restoring Mhrt to the pre-stress level protects the heart from hypertrophy and failure. Mhrt antagonizes the function of Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling factor that is activated by stress to trigger aberrant gene expression and cardiac myopathy3. Mhrt prevents Brg1 from recognizing its genomic DNA targets, thus inhibiting chromatin targeting and gene regulation by Brg1. It does so by binding to the helicase domain of Brg1, a domain that is crucial for tethering Brg1 to chromatinized DNA targets. Brg1 helicase has dual nucleic-acid-binding specificities: it is capable of binding lncRNA (Mhrt) and chromatinized—but not naked—DNA. This dual-binding feature of helicase enables a competitive inhibition mechanism by which Mhrt sequesters Brg1 from its genomic DNA targets to prevent chromatin remodelling. A Mhrt–Brg1 feedback circuit is thus crucial for heart function. Human MHRT also originates from MYH7 loci and is repressed in various types of myopathic hearts, suggesting a conserved lncRNA mechanism in human cardiomyopathy. Our studies identify a cardioprotective lncRNA, define a new targeting mechanism for ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factors, and establish a new paradigm for lncRNA–chromatin interaction.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49716	A long noncoding RNA protects the heart from pathological hypertrophy.

GSE34966	Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron	6	Expression profiling by array	GPL7006	Chronic colitis in Bacteroides Thetaiotaomicron-Monoassociated HLA-B27 Transgenic rats alters expression of receptor and metabolic genes in luminal bacteria.	2012-01-10	Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may be caused in part by aberrant immune responses to commensal intestinal microbes including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B.theta). Healthy, germ-free HLA-B27 transgenic (Tg) rats develop chronic colitis when colonized with complex gut commensal bacteria whereas non-transgenic (nTg) rats remain disease-free. However, the role of B.theta, a well-characterized anaerobic commensal bacterium, in causing disease in Tg rats is unknown nor is much known about how microbes respond to host inflammation. Methods: Tg and nTg rats were monoassociated with a human isolate of B.theta. Colonic inflammation was quantified by blinded histological scoring and real-time RT-PCR assays of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cecal bacterial concentrations were measured by quantitative plating. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of B.theta recovered from ceca was performed using custom GeneChips and data analyzed using dChip, Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. Results: B.theta monoassociated Tg rats had significantly more colonic inflammation and increased colonic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs compared to nTg controls. Transcriptional profiles of cecal B.theta were significantly different in Tg vs. nTg rats. GSEA revealed that the Gene Ontology molecular function of receptor activity, which is comprised mainly of genes that encode nutrient binding proteins, was significantly enriched with genes upregulated in B.theta from Tg rats. KEGG canonical pathways of ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and metabolism were significantly enriched with genes downregulated in B.theta from Tg rats. Numbers of viable bacteria/gram cecal contents in Tg vs. nTg rats were not significantly different. Conclusions: B.theta induces mild colitis in HLA-B27 Tg rats, which is associated with changes in the expression of microbial metabolic and nutrient binding pathways, but no difference in concentrations of luminal bacteria. Mechanistic studies of differentially expressed B.theta genes may reveal novel pathways that contribute to IBD.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE34966	The colitis-associated transcriptional profile of commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron enhances adaptive immune responses to a bacterial antigen.

We find that limitation for the amino acid arginine causes a selective loss of tRNA charging, which regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Interestingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. Chemical and genetic perturbation of mTORC1 and GCN2 signaling revealed that their robust response to leucine limitation prevents ribosome pausing, while an insufficient response to arginine limitation led to loss of arginine tRNA charging and ribosome pausing. Codon-specific ribosome pausing decreased protein production and triggered premature ribosome termination without significantly reducing mRNA levels. Together, our results suggest that amino acids which are not optimally sensed by the mTORC1 and GCN2 pathways still regulate translation through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism based on synonymous codon usage.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113751	Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells.

Employing ribosome profiling we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signaling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism, and invasion.

We further develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure.

Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. We develop a metric for distinguishing between 80S footprints and nonribosomal sources using footprint size distributions, which validates the vast majority of footprints outside of coding regions. We present evidence for polypeptide production beyond annotated genes, including induction of immune responses following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Translation is pervasive on cytosolic transcripts outside of conserved reading frames, and direct detection of this expanded universe of translated products enables efforts to understand how cells manage and exploit its consequences.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60095	Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive translation outside of annotated protein-coding genes.

To investigate RNA tails at the genomic scale, we previously developed TAIL-seq, but its low sensitivity precluded its application to biological materials of minute quantity. In this study, we report a new version of TAILseq (mRNA TAIL-seq or mTAIL-seq) with enhanced sequencing depth for mRNAs (by ~1000 fold compared to the previous version). The improved method allows us to investigate the regulation of poly(A) tail in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs are polyadenylated mainly during late oogenesis, prior to fertilization, and that further modulation occurs upon egg activation. Wispy, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase, adenylates the vast majority of maternal mRNAs with a few intriguing exceptions such as ribosomal protein transcripts. By comparing mTAILseq data with ribosome profiling data, we find a strong coupling between poly(A) tail length and translational efficiency during egg activation. Our data suggest that regulation of poly(A) tail in oocytes shapes the translatomic landscape of embryos, thereby directing the onset of animal development. By virtue of the high sensitivity, low cost, technical robustness, and broad accessibility, mTAIL-seq will be a potent tool to improve our understanding of mRNA tailing in diverse biological systems.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83731	mTAIL-seq reveals dynamic poly(A) tail regulation in oocyte-to-embryo development.

Some of these motifs are highly similar to the RNA binding motifs of a small list of RNA interacting proteins.

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The impact of posttranslational modifications has not yet been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging since individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes). Here, we develop polysome proteome profiling to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. Our method combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on the fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12/uL11 -- a known mitotic CDK1 substrate -- is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12/uL11 phosphorylation regulates translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis.

For an obligate intracellular parasite that is shielded from the cytosolic host immune factors by a parasitophorous vacuole, the brief entry into the extracellular space is likely to exert enormous stress. Due to its role in cellular stress response, we hypothesize that translational control plays an important role in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma during the lytic cycle. Unlike transcriptional profiles, insights into genome-wide translational profiles of Toxoplasma gondii are lacking. We have performed genome-wide ribosome profiling, coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, in intracellular and extracellular Toxoplasma gondii parasites to investigate translational control during the lytic cycle. Results: Although differences in transcript abundance were mostly mirrored at the translational level, we observed significant differences in the abundance of ribosome footprints between the two parasite stages. Furthermore, our data suggest that mRNA translation in the parasite is potentially regulated by mRNA secondary structure and upstream open reading frames.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99395	Comparative ribosome profiling uncovers a dominant role for translational control in Toxoplasma gondii.

All samples were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. LPS-responsive lncRNAs were found to be mostly cytoplasmic. Glycerol gradient datasets revealed that a substantial fraction of LPS-responsive lncRNAs, similar to mRNAs, co-sediments with ribosomal RNAs and also ribosomal proteins, as confirmed by mass-spectrometry analysis. LncRNAs not co-sedimenting with ribosomes displayed a highly heterogenous gradient distriubtion. Among these truly non-coding RNAs we identified lncRNA MaIL1 as a novel element of the macrophage TLR-TRIF signaling pathway contributing to antibacterial defense.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE101409	Noncoding RNA <i>MaIL1</i> is an integral component of the TLR4-TRIF pathway.

These collisions are known to trigger a series of events including degradation of the stalled nascent polypeptide, decay of the problematic mRNAs, and ribosome rescue. However, the systemic cellular response of ribosome collision has not been explored. Here, we uncover a novel function for ribosome collisions in signal transduction. Using multiple translation elongation inhibitors and cellular stress conditions, we show that ribosome collisions activate both the SAPK (Stress Activated Protein Kinase) and GCN2-mediated cellular stress response pathways that lead to apoptosis and the integrated stress response (ISR), respectively. We further show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions, and ZAK is required for activation of both SAPKs p38/JNK and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that ZAK preferentially associates with the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome, inducing ZAK phosphorylation. While ZAK associates with elongating ribosomes under non-stressed conditions, activation of ZAK is specifically trigger by colliding ribosomes. Together, these results provide new insights into how perturbation of translational homeostasis, as read-out by colliding ribosomes, regulates cell fate.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141459	Ribosome Collisions Trigger General Stress Responses to Regulate Cell Fate.

Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly, transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity, while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors.

However, their similarity and the fact that they tend to bind the same targets suggest that in some cases they may have an overlapping role. In this paper, we systematically knocked-out (KO) each of the three readers and the three together (triple-KO), and estimated the effect in-vitro in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and in-vivo, in viability and gametogenesis. We show that in mESCs there is a compensation between the three readers, with a dramatic hyper-pluripotent phenotype only in the triple-KO. However, in-vivo, Ythdf2 has a dominant role that cannot be compensated by Ythdf1 or Ythdf3, both in viability of the mouse pups and in gametogenesis. We suggest that compensation is dosage-dependent, and in-vivo we cannot detect it due to difference in the readers’ expression, both in level and in spatial location. In addition, we found that Ythdf1 and Ythdf3 specifically down-regulate 2-cell genes, that Ythdf2-KO in gametogenesis affects microtubuline related genes, and that Mettl3-KO severity is increased as the deletion occurs earlier in gametogenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148536	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA624906	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA624906	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP256256

Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, NSP1, for shutting down host translation. Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5′ terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158374	Genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts preferentially escape global suppression of translation by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein.	bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology	None	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.295493	{bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology (None): 10.1101/2020.09.13.295493}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA665035	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA665035	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP284977

GSE154488	Candida albicans	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other	GPL27827	Global Translational Landscape of the Candida albicans Morphological Transition	2020-07-15	Candida albicans is a major human fungal pathogen that represents the fourth leading cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in the U.S. and is associated with high mortality and/or morbidity rates in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, including cancer and AIDS patients. While the C. albicans morphological transition from yeast to filamentous cells is required for virulence, considerably little is known about translational mechanisms important for controlling this transition as well as other virulence-related processes in C. albicans and other human fungal pathogens. Using ribosome profiling, we report the first global translational profile associated with C. albicans morphogenesis. Strikingly, many genes involved in pathogenesis, filamentation, response to stress and cell wall organization show reduced translational efficiency (TE). Several of these genes are known to be strongly induced at the transcriptional level, suggesting that a translational fine-tuning mechanism is in place. Using a recently developed ORF-calling method, we have identified a significant number of potential uORFs in genes associated with pathogenesis and at least 57 potential novel ORFs, several of which appear to show altered TE in response to filamentation. Finally, using a novel method for global analysis of ribosome pausing from Ribo-seq data, we demonstrate an enrichment of ribosome pausing sites in C. albicans genes associated with protein synthesis and cell wall functions. Altogether, our results suggest that the C. albicans morphological transition is associated with widespread global translational alterations that do not simply reflect transcriptional changes and affect the expression of many genes associated with virulence-related processes and pathogenesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154488	Global translational landscape of the Candida albicans morphological transition.

We then profiled oligodendoglial (Olig2+) cells from a mouse model of Pdgf-driven glioma.

Using Illumina HumanWG-6 beadarray, we analyzed the expression of 47,296 transcripts in two groups of gastric cancer patients who all underwent surgical resection. Thirty-nine of 46 samples in group one were used as a training set to discover candidates for overall survival prediction by using semi-supervised method, resulting in a panel of 10 genes as prognosis markers. This 10-marker set classified each case into a low or a high risk group with significantly different survival times (P = 0.000047) and maintained independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. These 10 candidates were then verified in a fully independent validation set comprising 33 samples (P = 0.0009). Furthermore, the prognosis was consistent with the classical TNM staging system, and showed even better prediction. Interestingly, six of ten survival markers are ribosomal proteins, suggesting a possible association between deregulation of ribosome-related expression and poor prognosis. In conclusion, by whole genome expression profiling, 10 markers, including 6 ribosomal proteins, for overall survival prognosis of gastric cancer were found and validated, and which may be parallelly used with the TNM system.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21983	Discovery and validation of prognostic markers in gastric cancer by genome-wide expression profiling.

To better understand how Hsp90 can affect mRNA translation we screened more than 1600 factors involved in mRNA regulation for physical interactions with Hsp90 in human cells. The mRNA binding protein CPEB2 strongly binds Hsp90 via its prion domain. In a yeast model, transient inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in persistent activation of a CPEB translation reporter even in the absence of exogenous CPEB that persisted for 30 generations after the inhibitor was removed. Ribosomal profiling revealed that some endogenous yeast mRNAs, including HAC1, show a persistent change in translation efficiency following transient Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, transient loss of Hsp90 function can promote a non-genetic inheritance of a translational state affecting specific mRNAs, introducing a new mechanism by which Hsp90 can promote phenotypic variation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153945	None	None	None	None	None	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA644594	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA644594	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP270667

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (≥84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21992	Mammalian microRNAs predominantly act to decrease target mRNA levels.

We previously reported that ~800 gene transcripts are regulated following 6 weeks of supervised endurance training in young sedentary males, referred to as the training responsive transcriptome (TRT). Here we utilized this database together with data on biological variation in muscle adaptation to aerobic endurance training in both humans and a novel out-bred rodent model to study the potential regulatory molecules that coordinate this complex network of genes. We identified three DNA sequences representing RUNX1, SOX9, and PAX3 transcription factor binding sites as over-represented in the TRT. In turn, miRNA profiling indicated that several miRNAs targeting RUNX1, SOX9 and PAX3 were down-regulated by endurance training. The TRT was then examined by contrasting subjects who demonstrated the least vs. the greatest improvement in aerobic capacity (low vs. high responders), and at least 100 of the 800 TRT genes were differentially regulated, thus suggesting regulation of these genes may be important for improving aerobic capacity. In high responders, pro-angiogenic and tissue developmental networks emerged as key candidates for coordinating tissue aerobic adaptation. Beyond RNA level validation there were several DNA variants that associated with VO(2)max trainability in the HERITAGE Family Study but these did not pass conservative Bonferroni adjustment. In addition, in a rat model selected across 10 generations for high aerobic training responsiveness, we found that both the TRT and a homologous subset of the human high responder genes were regulated to a greater degree in high responder rodent skeletal muscle. This analysis provides a comprehensive map of the transcriptomic features important for aerobic exercise-induced improvements in maximal oxygen consumption.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE35659	A transcriptional map of the impact of endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle phenotype.

To identify new regulators of erythropoiesis, we performed a functional genomic screen for genes affecting expression of the erythroid marker CD235a/GYPA. Among validating hits were genes coding for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) complex, including, METTL14, METTL3, and WTAP. We found that m6A MTase activity promotes erythroid gene expression programs through selective translation of ~300 m6A marked mRNAs, including those coding for SETD histone methyltransferases, ribosomal components, and polyA RNA binding proteins, and novel genes. Remarkably, loss of m6A marks resulted in dramatic loss of H3K4me3 marks across key erythroid-specific KLF1 transcriptional targets (e.g., Heme biosynthesis genes). Further, each m6A MTase subunit and a subset of their mRNAs targets are required for human erythroid specification in primary bone-marrow derived progenitors. Thus, m6A mRNA marks promote the translation of a network of genes required for human erythropoiesis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE105782	N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine mRNA marking promotes selective translation of regulons required for human erythropoiesis.

However, recent studies have challenged this view, showing that poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency are decoupled in non-embryonic cells. Using TAIL-seq and ribosome profiling, we investigate poly(A) tail dynamics and translational control in the somatic cell cycle. We find dramatic changes in poly(A) tail lengths of cell cycle regulatory genes like CDK1, TOP2A, and FBXO5, explaining their translational repression in M phase. We also find that poly(A) tail length is coupled to translation when the poly(A) tail is <20 nucleotides. However, as most genes have >20 nucleotide poly(A) tails, their translation is regulated mainly via poly(A) tail length-independent mechanisms during the cell cycle.

Automated annotation strategies rely on assumptions about protein-coding sequences (CDSs), e.g., they are conserved, do not overlap, and exceed a minimum length. However, an increasing number of newly discovered proteins violate these rules. Here we present an experimental and analytical framework, based on ribosome profiling and linear regression, for systematic identification and quantification of translation. Application of this approach to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells and HCMV-infected human fibroblasts identifies thousands of novel CDSs, including micropeptides and variants of known proteins, that bear the hallmarks of canonical translation and exhibit comparable translation levels and dynamics to annotated CDSs. Remarkably, many translation events are identified in both mouse and human cells even when the peptide sequence is not conserved. Our work thus reveals an unexpected complexity to mammalian translation suited to provide both conserved regulatory or protein-based functions.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74139	A Regression-Based Analysis of Ribosome-Profiling Data Reveals a Conserved Complexity to Mammalian Translation.

METTL3 can promote translation but the mechanism and widespread relevance remain unknown. Here we show that METTL3 enhances translation only when tethered to reporter mRNA at sites close to the stop codon supporting a mRNA looping mechanism for ribosome recycling and translational control. Electron microscopy revealed the topology of individual polyribosomes with single METTL3 foci found in close proximity to 5’ cap-binding proteins. We identify a direct physical and functional interaction between METTL3 and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit h (eIF3h). METTL3 promotes translation of a large subset of oncogenic mRNAs, including BRD4 that are also m6A-modified in human primary lung tumors. The METTL3-eIF3h interaction is required for enhanced translation, formation of densely packed polyribosomes, and oncogenic transformation. METTL3 depletion inhibits tumorigenicity and sensitizes lung cancer cells to BRD4 inhibition. These findings uncover a mRNA looping mechanism of translation control and identify METTL3-eIF3h as a potential cancer therapeutic target.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117299	mRNA circularization by METTL3-eIF3h enhances translation and promotes oncogenesis.

Our study reveals this phenomenon impacts hundreds of genes in aged D1 spiny projection neurons of the mouse striatum and also occurs in the aging human brain. Isolated 3' UTR accumulation is tightly correlated with mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative stress, with full-length mRNA expression that is reduced but not eliminated and with production of short 3' UTR-encoded peptides. Depletion of the oxidation-sensitive Fe-S cluster ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 induces the accumulation of 3' UTRs, consistent with a model in which ribosome stalling and mRNA cleavage by No-Go decay yields isolated 3' UTR RNAs protected by ribosomes. Isolated 3' UTR accumulation is a hallmark of brain aging, likely reflecting regional differences in metabolism and oxidative stress.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97461	Widespread Accumulation of Ribosome-Associated Isolated 3' UTRs in Neuronal Cell Populations of the Aging Brain.

GSE59983	Homo sapiens	76	Expression profiling by array	GPL13158	Gene expression profiling of primary human retinoblastoma	2014-07-31	Background Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye cancer associated with RB1 loss or MYCN amplification (RB1+/+MYCNA). There are controversies concerning the existence of molecular subtypes within RB1-/- retinoblastoma. To test whether these molecular subtypes exist, we performed molecular profiling. Methods Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling was performed on 76 primary human retinoblastomas. Expression profiling was complemented by genome-wide DNA profiling and clinical, histopathological, and ex vivo drug sensitivity data. Findings RNA and DNA profiling identified major variability between retinoblastomas. While gene expression differences between RB1+/+MYCNA and RB1-/- tumors seemed more dichotomous, differences within the RB1-/- tumors were gradual. Tumors with high expression of a photoreceptor gene signature were highly differentiated, smaller in volume and diagnosed at younger age compared to tumors with low photoreceptor signature expression. Tumors with lower photoreceptor expression showed increased expression of genes involved in M-phase and mRNA and ribosome synthesis and increased frequencies of somatic copy number alterations. Interpretation Molecular, clinical and histopathological differences between RB1-/- tumors are best explained by tumor progression, reflected by a gradual loss of differentiation and photoreceptor expression signature. Since copy number alterations were more frequent in tumors with less photoreceptorness, genomic alterations might be drivers of tumor progression.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59983	Loss of photoreceptorness and gain of genomic alterations in retinoblastoma reveal tumor progression.

We present a protocol for genome-wide, quantitative analysis of in vivo translation by deep sequencing. This ribosome profiling approach maps the exact positions of ribosomes on transcripts by nuclease footprinting. The nuclease-protected mRNA fragments are converted into a DNA library suitable for deep sequencing using a strategy that minimizes bias. The abundance of different footprint fragments in deep sequencing data reports on the amount of translation of a gene. Additionally, footprints reveal the exact regions of the transcriptome that are translated. To better define translated reading frames, we describe an adaptation that reveals the sites of translation initiation by pre-treating cells with harringtonine to immobilize initiating ribosomes. The protocol we describe requires 5 - 7 days to generate a completed ribosome profiling sequencing library.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37744	The ribosome profiling strategy for monitoring translation in vivo by deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments.

We used multiple elongation inhibitors and chemical probing to define ribosome conformational states corresponding to different sized ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) generated by ribosome profiling. We show using various genetic and environmental perturbations that the previously identified 20-22 nucleotide (nt) RPFs correspond predominantly to ribosomes in a pre-accommodation state with an open 40S ribosomal A site while the classical 27-29 nt fragments correspond to ribosomes in a pre-translocation state with an occupied 40S ribosomal A site. These distinct ribosome conformational states revealed by ribosome profiling are seen in all eukaryotes tested including fungi, worms and mammals. This high-resolution ribosome profiling approach reveals the anticipated Rck2-dependent inhibition of translocation through eEF2 phosphorylation during hyperosmotic stress. These same approaches reveal a strong translation elongation arrest during oxidative stress where the ribosomes are trapped in a pre-translocation state, but in this case the translational arrest is independent of Rck2-driven eEF2 phosphorylation. These results provide new insights and approaches for defining the molecular events that impact translation elongation throughout biology.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE115161	Molecular mechanism of translational stalling by inhibitory codon combinations and poly(A) tracts.

The recent development of ribosome footprint profiling provides an important new tool for measuring translation. Here we describe riboHMM, a new method that uses ribosome footprint data along with gene expression and sequence information to accurately infer translated sequences. We applied our method to human lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified 7,863 previously unannotated coding sequences, including 445 translated sequences in pseudogenes and 2,442 translated upstream open reading frames. We observed an enrichment of harringtonine-treated ribosome footprints at the inferred initiation sites, validating many of the novel coding sequences. In aggregate, the novel sequences exhibit significant signatures of purifying selection indicative of protein-coding function, suggesting that many of the novel sequences are functional. We observed that nearly 40% of bicistronic transcripts showed significant negative correlation in the levels of translation of their two coding sequences, suggesting a key regulatory role for these novel translated sequences. Despite evidence for their functional importance, the novel peptide sequences were detected by mass spectrometry at a lower rate than predicted based on data from annotated proteins, thus suggesting that many of the novel peptide products may be relatively short-lived. Our work illustrates the value of ribosome profiling for improving coding annotations, and significantly expands the set of known coding regions.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75290	Thousands of novel translated open reading frames in humans inferred by ribosome footprint profiling.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13328	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.13328}	'cytoplasmic RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA303958	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA303958	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP066598

The relative strength of these events is difficult to predict, leaving uncertainty as to the therapeutic benefits of Nutlin. Here, we report a new translation control mechanism shaping p53-dependent apoptosis. We performed polysomal profiling in the cell lines SJSA1 and HCT116, of which only the first undergoes robust cell death in response to p53 activation by Nutlin. We establish Nutlin-induced apoptosis in SJSA1 cells to be associated with a set of translationally enhanced mRNAs carrying a newly identified 3’UTR motif which we labeled CG-motif. We identified PCBP2 and DHX30 as interactor proteins of the CG-motif that are more abundant in HCT116 cells compared to SJSA1. The binding of DHX30 to the CG-motif detected in HCT116 cells was shown to be dependent on PCBP2. Interestingly, DHX30 depletion enhances polysome association of CG-motif mRNAs in HCT116 cells, shifting their outcome towards apoptosis. In U2OS, an osteosarcoma-derived cell line that unlike SJSA1 undergoes persistent cell cycle arrest in response to Nutlin, DHX30 is highly expressed and its depletion enhances the expression of CG-motif mRNAs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95024	Nutlin-Induced Apoptosis Is Specified by a Translation Program Regulated by PCBP2 and DHX30.

Initiation of translation is highly regulated in eukaryotes and is considered as the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis. mRNA secondary structures in 5’ untranslated region (UTR) and associated helicases have been characterised as key determinants of translation initiation. Nevertheless the transcriptome-wide contribution of non-canonical secondary structures, such as RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s), to the translation of human mRNAs remains largely unappreciated. Here we use a ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape associated to rG4s-containing mRNAs and the contribution of two rG4s-specialised DExH-box helicases, DHX9 and DHX36, to translation initiation in human cells. We show that rG4-forming sequences in 5’-UTR is associated with decreased translation efficiency which correlate with an increased ribosome density within the 5’-UTRs. We found that rG4s contribute to the translation of upstream open reading frames, and as a consequence, thwart the translation of the associated protein coding sequences (CDS). Depletion of the DHX36 and DHX9 helicases demonstrated that the formation of the rG4 structural motif rather than its nucleotide sequence mediate translation initiation.

Global transcriptional profiling revealed evolutionarily conserved roles for Tor1 in regulating the expression of genes involved in nitrogen starvation responses and ribosome biogenesis. Interestingly, we found that in C. albicans Tor1 plays a novel role in regulating the expression of several cell wall and hyphal specific genes, including adhesins and their transcriptional repressors Nrg1 and Tup1. In accord with this transcriptional profile, rapamycin induced extensive cellular aggregation in an adhesin-dependent fashion. Moreover, adhesin gene induction and cellular aggregation of rapamycin-treated cells were strongly dependent on the transactivators Bcr1 and Efg1. These findings support models in which Tor1 negatively controls cellular adhesion by governing the activities of Bcr1 and Efg1. Taken together, these results provide evidence that Tor1-mediated cellular adhesion might be broadly conserved among eukaryotic organisms.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13176	The protein kinase Tor1 regulates adhesin gene expression in Candida albicans.

From within the parasitophorous vacuole in which they reside, Toxoplasma tachyzoites secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that can reprogram host gene expression to facilitate parasite survival and replication. Gaining a better understanding of how host gene expression is altered upon infection is central for understanding parasite strategies for host invasion and for developing new parasite therapies. Here, we applied ribosome profiling coupled with mRNA measurements to concurrently study gene expression in the parasite and in host human foreskin fibroblasts. By examining the parasite transcriptome and translatome, we identified potential upstream open reading frames that may permit the stress-induced preferential translation of parasite mRNAs. We also determined that tachyzoites reduce host death-associated pathways and increase survival, proliferation, and motility in both quiescent and proliferative host cell models of infection. Additionally, proliferative cells alter their gene expression in ways consistent with massive transcriptional rewiring while quiescent cells were best characterized by re-entry into the cell cycle. We also identified a translational control regimen consistent with mTOR activation in quiescent cells, and to a lesser degree in proliferative cells. This study illustrates the utility of the method for dissection of gene expression programs simultaneously in parasite and host.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE129869	Simultaneous Ribosome Profiling of Human Host Cells Infected with Toxoplasma gondii.	mSphere	4.447	https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00292-19	{mSphere (4.447): 10.1128/mSphere.00292-19}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA533074	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA533074	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP192707

Measures of transcriptional mRNA levels may therefore misrepresent cellular activation. To test this hypothesis employing human physiological mRNA levels, we analyzed cytoplasmic and polyribosome-bound mRNA expression (Frac-seq) combined with microRNA profiling by small RNA-seq in bronchoepithelial cells from healthy and severe asthma (SA) donors, SA being a chronic inflammatory airways disease, poorly understood at the molecular level. We found 275 genes bound to polyribosomes differentially between healthy and severe asthma, of which only 11.64% overlapped with differentially expressed cytoplasmic mRNAs (226 genes). We found 335 alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms differentially bound to polyribosomes of which only ~8% were revealed by cytoplasmic mRNA analysis. Approximately two thirds of differentially expressed isoforms could not be found at the gene level in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound fractions, demonstrating the disruption of splicing in asthma. Only the analysis of differentially expressed isoforms bound to polyribosomes revealed disease-related pathways overlooked in total mRNA. We detected a network of 21 microRNAs differentially expressed, with 8 microRNAs accounting for more than 80% targeting observed in both cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNA isoforms. Importantly, microRNAs target distinct cytoplasmic and polyribosome bound mRNAs. Hence this work, integrating deep-sequencing, subcellular fractionation and microRNA profiling, demonstrates the disruption of post-transcriptional regulatory processes as the main disease causing molecular mechanism in asthma, something that cannot be dissected employing more classic transcriptomics approaches alone.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85215	Genome-Wide Posttranscriptional Dysregulation by MicroRNAs in Human Asthma as Revealed by Frac-seq.

Growing evidence indicate though that mitochondrial translation differs from its bacterial counterpart in many key aspects. In this analysis, we used the ribosome profiling technology to generate a genome-wide snapshot view of mitochondrial translation in Arabidopsis. We show that, unlike in humans, most Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosomes footprints measure 27 and 28 bases. We also reveal that respiratory subunits encoding mRNAs show much higher ribosome association than other mitochondrial mRNAs, implying that they are translated to higher levels. Homogenous ribosome densities were generally detected within each respiratory complex except for complex V where higher ribosome coverage corroborate with higher needs in specific subunits. In complex I respiratory mutants, a slight reorganization of mitochondrial mRNAs ribosome association was detected involving an increase in ribosome densities on certain ribosomal protein encoding transcripts and a reduction in the translation of a few complex V mRNAs. Altogether, our observations reveal that plant mitochondrial translation is a dynamic process and that translational control is important for gene expression in plant mitochondria. This study paves the way for future advances in the understanding of translation in higher plant mitochondria.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104028	The translational landscape of Arabidopsis mitochondria.

It regulates multiple steps throughout the RNA life cycle including RNA processing, translation, and metabolism, via the recognition by selective binding proteins. In cytoplasm, m6A binding protein YTHDF1 facilitates translation of m6A-modified mRNAs, and YTHDF2 accelerates the decay of m6A-modified transcripts. The biological function of YTHDF3, another cytoplasmic m6A binder of the YTH domain family, remains unknown. Here, we report that YTHDF3 promotes protein synthesis in synergy with YTHDF1, and affects methylated mRNA decay mediated by YTHDF2. Cells deficient in all of YTHDF proteins experience the most dramatic accumulation of the m6A-methylated transcripts. These results indicate that in cytoplasm, YTHDF proteins act in an integrated and cooperative network to accelerate metabolism of m6A-modified mRNAs.

The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, as viral polymerases cleave 5′m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (‘cap-snatching’). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could drive the expression of chimeric human-viral coding sequences. Here, we report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination (‘start-snatching’), which creates, depending on the translatability of the viral UTRs, human-virus protein chimeras either as N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting. We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, can generate T cell responses and contribute to virulence. Our results indicate that IAV, and likely a multitude of other human-, animal- and plant-viruses, use this host-dependent mechanism to expand their proteome diversity during infection.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148245	Hybrid Gene Origination Creates Human-Virus Chimeric Proteins during Infection.

We previously reported that mTORC1 was inhibited and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells. Treatment of RBS cells with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division. In this study, we use RBS as a model for mTOR inhibition and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine genome-wide effects of L-leucine. The translational efficiency of many genes is increased with Lleucine in RBS cells including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and mitochondrial function. snoRNAs are strongly upregulated in RBS cells, but decreased with L-leucine. Imprinted genes, including H19 and GTL2, are differentially expressed in RBS cells consistent with contribution to mTORC1 control. This study reveals dramatic effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 and supports that ESCO2 function is required for normal gene expression and translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64962	Improved transcription and translation with L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 in Roberts syndrome.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo.

However, how this is molecularly achieved remains largely unresolved. Here, we develop an in vivo mouse model of liver cancer to study oncogene cooperation in immunosurveillance. We show that MYC overexpression (MYCTg) synergizes with KRASG12D to induce an aggressive liver tumor leading to metastasis formation and reduced mouse survival compared with KRASG12D alone. Genome-wide ribosomal footprinting of MYCTg;KRASG12 tumors compared with KRASG12D revealed potential alterations in translation of mRNAs, including programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further analysis revealed that PD-L1 translation is repressed in KRASG12D tumors by functional, non-canonical upstream open reading frames in its 5′ untranslated region, which is bypassed in MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors to evade immune attack. We show that this mechanism of PD-L1 translational upregulation was effectively targeted by a potent, clinical compound that inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation, eFT508, which reverses the aggressive and metastatic characteristics of MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors.

It is an established notion that translational control takes place essentially at the translation initiation level, therefore the variation in abundance of a given mRNA species on polysomes can be directly related to the variation in abundance of the corresponding protein. Comparison of translatome profile changes with corresponding transcriptome profile changes can provide a measure of the degree of concordance between cellular controls affecting mRNA abundance and cellular controls affecting mRNA availability to translation. To provide a direct experimental evaluation of the phenomenon, we decided to study a classical example of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) treatment. This stimulus triggers a well known chain of intracellular transduction events, ultimately resulting in a multifaceted phenotypic spectrum of changes with prevalent induction of cell growth and proliferation. We subjected HeLa cells to serum starvation for 12h and then we added EGF at final concentration of 1 μg/ml, profiling before and after 40 minutes of treatment the transcriptome, the translatome, coming from the polysomal pool of mRNAs after sucrose gradient separation, and also the mRNA content of the subpolysomal pool, expected not to be actively translated.

The normal function of DDX3X is poorly understood, and the consequences of its cancer-associated mutations have not been explored. Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation–high-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5’ bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59095	Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.

Interestingly, our systematic analysis reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and the extent of cellular mRNAs reduction is strongly related to transcripts’ length and GC content.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE82232	A systematic view on influenza induced host shutoff.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18311	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.18311}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA324409	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA324409	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP076102

Deep RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling were employed to systematically analyze messenger RNA and ribosome-protected RNA in EV71-infected rhabdomyosarcoma cells at progressive time points following infection. The analysis characterized the dynamic transcriptional and translational landscapes of both the virus and host cells. The results indicated that reduced translation of cellular mRNAs played a key role in EV71-induced host shutoff rather than mRNA depletion. During the host shutoff, EV71 protein was preferably synthesized through both a translational advantage and abundant mRNA production. Moreover, a small number of cellular genes were resistant to the host shutoff through both transcriptional and translational regulation, including genes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that is important for EV71 replication. These results indicated selective cellular protein synthesis during EV71-induced host shutoff as a mechanism the virus utilizes to benefit its replication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE103308	Simultaneous and systematic analysis of cellular and viral gene expression during Enterovirus 71-induced host shutoff.

Like other herpesviruses, our understanding of their protein coding potential is far from complete. Here we use ribosome profiling and RNA-seq to experimentally define the HHV-6 translation products and to follow their temporal expression. We identified hundreds of new open reading frames (ORF)s, including many upstream ORFs (uORF)s and internal ORFs (iORF)s, generating a complete atlas of HHV-6 translation products. Integrating data from human cytomegalovirus we uncover numerous uORFs and iORFs that are conserved between beta herpesviruses and we show uORFs are specifically enriched in late viral genes. We also identified three highly abundant viral long non coding RNAs (lncRNA)s and we show one of these lncRNAs generate a non-polyadenylated stable intron that is conserved between all sequenced beta herpesviruses. Overall, this work uncovers the full complexity of the HHV-6 family genomes and highlights novel features that are conserved between beta herpesviruses, providing a resource for future functional studies.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135363	Comprehensive annotations of human herpesvirus 6A and 6B genomes reveal novel and conserved genomic features.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50960	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.50960}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA558563	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA558563	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP217339

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71895	AKT Inhibition Promotes Nonautonomous Cancer Cell Survival.

Therefore, cells tightly control mRNA translation rates in response to external stimuli (growth factors, differentiation signals) and the internal resources available (nutrients, energy). We set out to unravel new molecular mechanisms of global translation control required for cellular homeostasis. Using a siRNA screening approach to knock-down all human kinases and phosphatases, we analyzed the impact of protein phosphorylation on translation regulation in unstressed, proliferating cells. A visual screen was conducted to assess stress granule formation (as a consequence of translational shutdown) in the absence of 711 kinases and 256 phosphatases. Several candidates identified in the screen are linked, either directly or indirectly, to cell cycle regulation. We further identified a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), whose genetic downregulation or chemical inhibition results in global translation suppression. In order to assess CDK downstream signaling, we performed phosphoproteomics analysis and found the phosphorylation status of many ribosomal proteins to be altered upon CDK inhibition. Indeed, we could show that S6-kinase 1 partially contributes to CDK-dependent translational control. Ribosome profiling further revealed that the translation of 5’TOP mRNAs, including many mRNAs encoding for ribosomal proteins, is especially sensitive to CDK inhibition. While the translation regulatory function of this kinase is independent of the cell cycle phase, its activity is ideally suited to couple the overall proliferation rate of cells to the global rate of protein synthesis. Our results identify a pathway that enables cells to directly adapt protein homeostasis to proliferation and growth signals.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE128538	CDK1 couples proliferation with protein synthesis.

We found that circMYBL2 knockdown specifically inhibits proliferation and promotes the differentiation of FLT3-ITD AML cells in vitro and in vivo. We used the ribosome profiling and RNA-seq libraries sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 to identify the mRNA that circMYBL2 targeted. Interestingly, we found that circMYBL2 significantly influences the protein level of mutant FLT3 kinase, which contributes to the activation of FLT3-ITD-dependent signaling pathways. Mechanistically, circMYBL2 enhanced the translational efficiency of FLT3 kinase by increasing the binding of PTBP1 to FLT3 mRNA. Moreover, circMYBL2 knockdown impaired the cytoactivity of inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive cells, with a significant decrease in FLT3 kinase expression, followed by the inactivation of its downstream pathways. In summary, we are the first to reveal a circRNA that specifically influences FLT3-ITD AML and regulates FLT3 kinase levels through translational regulation, suggesting that circMYBL2 may be a potential therapeutic target for FLT3-ITD AML.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133925	circMYBL2, a circRNA from MYBL2, regulates FLT3 translation by recruiting PTBP1 to promote FLT3-ITD AML progression.

High-throughput small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) has been widely adopted to investigate the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs. However, accurate quantification of miRNAs has been limited owing to the severe ligation bias in conventional sRNA-seq methods. Here we quantify miRNAs and their variants (known as isomiRs) by an improved sRNA-seq protocol, termed AQ-seq (accurate quantification by sequencing), that utilizes adapters with terminal degenerate sequences and a high concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which minimize the ligation bias during library preparation. Measurement using AQ-seq allows us to correct the previously misannotated 5′ end usage and strand preference in public databases. Importantly, the analysis of 5′ terminal heterogeneity reveals widespread alternative processing events which have been underestimated. We also identify highly uridylated miRNAs originating from the 3p strands, indicating regulations mediated by terminal uridylyl transferases at the pre-miRNA stage. Taken together, our study reveals the complexity of the miRNA isoform landscape, allowing us to refine miRNA annotation and to advance our understanding of miRNA regulation. Furthermore, AQ-seq can be adopted to improve other ligation-based sequencing methods including crosslinking-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (CLIP-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123627	Bias-minimized quantification of microRNA reveals widespread alternative processing and 3' end modification.

While the regulation of ribosome elongation is well studied in bacteria and yeast, less is known in higher eukaryotes. Here, we combined ribosome and tRNA profiling to investigate the relations between ribosome elongation rates, (aminoacyl-) tRNA levels and codon usage in mammals. We modeled codon-specific ribosome dwell times and translation fluxes from ribosome profiling, considering pair-interactions between ribosome sites. In mouse liver, the model revealed site and codon specific dwell times, as well as codon pair-interactions clustering by amino acids. While translation fluxes varied significantly across diurnal time and feeding regimen, codon dwell times were highly stable, and conserved in human. Fasting had no effect on codon dwell times in mouse liver. Profiling of total and aminoacylated tRNAs revealed highly heterogeneous levels with specific isoacceptor patterns and a correlation with codon usage. tRNAs for isoleucine, asparagine, aspartate and arginine were lowly loaded and conserved in fasted mice. Finally, codons with low levels of charged tRNAs and high codon usage relative to tRNA abundance exhibited long dwell times. Together, these analyses pave the way towards understanding the complex relation between tRNA loading, codon usage and ribosome dwell times in mammals.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126383	Robust landscapes of ribosome dwell times and aminoacyl-tRNAs in response to nutrient stress in liver.

Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in Drosophila melanogaster, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for Drosophila melanogaster, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within D. melanogaster and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49197	Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive and regulated stop codon readthrough in Drosophila melanogaster.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01179	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.01179}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA213294	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA213294	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP028243

Nonsense suppression therapy aims to restore protein function by suppressing termination at PTCs (called readthrough, or RT). However, the efficiency of current readthrough agents is generally quite low. We reasoned that by stimulating both readthrough and increasing mRNA levels, greater protein function can be restored than with readthrough alone. In this study, we developed a series of novel NanoLuc reporters designed to identify and differentiate compounds that induce readthrough, enhance mRNA abundance (by NMD inhibition or other mechanisms), or target both mechanisms simultaneously (referred to as dual RT/NMD reporters). We show that treatments that promote readthrough and NMD inhibition led to synergistic increases in NanoLuc activity of the RT/NMD reporter over either condition alone. We then used a dual RT/NMD reporter to carry out a high throughput screen of a library of 771,345 compounds. We identified 180 compounds with the ability to increase NanoLuc activity in our dual RT/NMD reporter assay. To confirm that such synergy can also amplify protein function in a disease model, we treated cells expressing a CFTR-Y122X mini-intron construct with one hit from this screen, SRI-37240. We found that this compound produced a much larger increase in CFTR activity compared to either the RT compound G418 +/- the NMD inhibitor amlexanox, and the activity obtained could be further enhanced with CFTR modulators. These results confirm the utility of these new reporters to identify many potent new molecules that counteract the effects of nonsense mutations.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144140	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA602876	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA602876	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP244347

To better understand the oncogenic program driven by MYC and investigate its potential as a therapeutic target, we screened a chemically diverse small molecule library for anti-MM activity. The most potent hits identified were rocaglate-scaffold inhibitors of translation initiation. Expression profiling of MM cells revealed reversion of the oncogenic MYC-driven transcriptional program by CMLD010509, our most promising rocaglate.

NMD is a RNA quality control mechanism, which detects and degrades aberrant mRNAs as well as some normal transcripts including those that harbor upstream open reading frames in their 5' leader sequence and long 3′ UTR. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the effect of either eRF3 or Upf1 depletion in human cells. Our bioinformatics analyses allow to delineate the features of the transcripts controlled by eRF3 and Upf1 and to compare the effect of each of these factors on gene expression. We show that eRF3 and Upf1 have very different impact on the human transcriptome, only ~250 transcripts being targeted by both factors. We also show that in contrast to Upf1, eRF3a depletion globally derepressed the expression of mRNAs containing translated uORFs. Finally, we find that eRF3a and Upf1 have opposite effects on ribosome protein gene expression. Together, our results provide important elements for understanding the impact of translation termination and NMD on the human transcriptome and reveal novel determinants of ribosome biogenesis regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126385	Divergent effects of translation termination factor eRF3A and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor UPF1 on the expression of uORF carrying mRNAs and ribosome protein genes.

Human eEF1A is post-translationally methylated on several lysine residues as well as on the N-terminus and until recently the responsible methyltransferases were largely elusive. Using mass spectrometry based screens, gene targeted cells and in vitro enzymology we identify the human methyltransferase like proteins 13 (METTL13), which contains two distinct methyltransferase domains, as an enzyme catalyzing both dimethylation of Lys55 and trimethylation of the N-terminus of eEF1A. Moreover, through ribosome profiling we demonstrate that loss of METTL13 function alters translation dynamics and results in changed translation rate of specific codons.

Since cancer initiation is complex we used a multi-omic approach to identify gene expression patterns that distinguish COPD stroma in patients with or without lung cancer. We obtained lung tissue from patients with COPD and lung cancer (tumor and adjacent non-malignant tissue) and those with COPD without lung cancer for proteomic and mRNA (cytoplasmic and polyribosomal) profiling. We used the joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) method to integrate and analysis across the three datasets. JIVE identified eight latent patterns that robustly distinguished and separated the three groups of tissue samples. Predictive variables that associated with the tumor, compared to adjacent stroma, were mainly represented in the transcriptomic data, whereas, predictive variables associated with adjacent tissue compared to controls was represented at the translatomic level. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed extracellular matrix (ECM) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways as important signals in the pre-malignant stroma. COPD stroma adjacent to lung cancer is unique and differs from non-malignant COPD tissue and is distinguished by the extracellular matrix and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE106899	Multi-omic molecular profiling of lung cancer in COPD.

Here we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including ERVs, and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly, this leads to dsRNA stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhances tumor immunogenicity and T cell infiltration in poorly immunogenic tumors, and elicits significant responses of checkpoint blockade-refractory mouse melanoma to anti-PD-1 therapy. Consistently, TCGA data analysis shows an inverse correlation between LSD1 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration in various human cancers. Our study identifies LSD1 as a potent inhibitor of anti-tumor immunity and responsiveness to immunotherapy, and suggests LSD1 inhibition combined with PD-(L)1 blockade as a novel cancer treatment strategy.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112230	LSD1 Ablation Stimulates Anti-tumor Immunity and Enables Checkpoint Blockade.

Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138638	Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576649	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576649	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224952

The human fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) responds to environmental or host temperature by initiating unique transcriptional programs to specify multicellular (hyphae) or unicellular (yeast) developmental states that function in infectivity or pathogenesis, respectively. Here we used recent advances in next-generation sequencing to uncover a novel post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation in Hc developmental cell types. We found that ~2% percent of Hc transcripts exhibit 5’ leader sequences that differ markedly in length between morphogenetic states. Ribosome density and mRNA abundance measurements uncovered a class of differential leader transcripts that exhibit tight transcriptional and translational regulation. Further examination of these dually regulated genes revealed that some control Hc morphology and that their strict regulation is necessary for the pathogen to make appropriate developmental decisions in response to temperature.

The anticodon modification mcm5s2U34 is required for normal growth and stress resistance in yeast; mutants lacking this modification have numerous phenotypes. Mutations in the homologous human genes are linked to neurological disease. The yeast phenotypes can be ameliorated by overexpression of specific tRNAs, suggesting that the modifications are necessary for efficient translation of specific codons. We determined the in vivo ribosome distributions at single codon resolution in yeast strains lacking mcm5s2U. We found accumulations at AAA, CAA, and GAA codons, suggesting that translation is slow when these codons are in the ribosomal A site, but these changes appeared too small to affect protein output. Instead, we observed activation of the GCN4-mediated stress response by a non- canonical pathway. Thus, loss of mcm5s2U causes global effects on gene expression due to perturbation of cellular signaling.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45366	Loss of a conserved tRNA anticodon modification perturbs cellular signaling.

SECIS-binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) increases the efficiency of this process. Pathogenic mutations in SECISBP2 reduce selenoprotein expression and lead to phenotypes associated with the reduction of deiodinase activities and selenoprotein N expression in humans. Two functions have been ascribed to SECISBP2: binding of SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNAs and facilitation of co-translational Sec insertion. To separately probe both functions, we established here two mouse models carrying two pathogenic missense mutations in Secisbp2 previously identified in patients. We found that the C696R substitution in the RNAbinding domain abrogates SECIS binding and does not support selenoprotein translation above the level of a complete Secisbp2 null mutation. The R543Q missense substitution located in the selenocysteine insertion domain resulted in residual activity and caused reduced selenoprotein translation, as demonstrated by ribosomal profiling to determine the impact on UGA re-coding in individual selenoproteins. We found, however, that the R543Q variant is thermally unstable in vitro and completely degraded in the mouse liver in vivo, while being partially functional in the brain. The moderate impairment of selenoprotein expression in neurons led to astrogliosis and transcriptional induction of genes associated with immune responses. We conclude that differential SECISBP2 protein stability in individual cell types may dictate clinical phenotypes to a much greater extent than molecular interactions involving a mutated amino acid in SECISBP2 .	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119681	Ribosome profiling of selenoproteins <i>in vivo</i> reveals consequences of pathogenic <i>Secisbp2</i> missense mutations.

GSE61742	Homo sapiens	72	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL16791	Impact of regulatory variation from RNA to protein	2014-09-25	Genetic variants that impact gene regulation are important contributors to human phenotypic variation. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made to identify genetic associations with differences in mRNA levels of nearby genes, namely, cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The phenotypic consequences of eQTLs are presumably due, in most cases, to their ultimate effects on protein expression levels. Yet, only few studies have quantified the impact of genetic variation on proteins levels directly. It remains unclear how faithfully eQTLs are reflected at the protein level, and whether there is a significant layer of cis regulatory variation acting primarily on translation or steady state protein levels. To address these questions, we measured ribosome occupancy by high-throughput sequencing, and relative protein levels by high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in which we had previously measured transcript expression using RNA sequencing. We then mapped genetic variants that are associated with changes in transcript expression (eQTLs), ribosome occupancy (rQTLs), or protein abundance (pQTLs). Most of the QTLs we detected are associated with transcript expression levels, with consequent effects on ribosome and protein levels. However, we found that eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, suggesting that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of a class of cis QTLs that specifically affect protein abundance with little or no effect on mRNA levels; most of these QTLs have little effect on ribosome occupancy, and hence may arise from differences in post-translational regulation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61742	Genomic variation.

The 5q- syndrome is a somatic ribosomopathy linked to RPS14 gene haploinsufficiency and characterized by a prominent erythroid hypoplasia. Using quantitative proteomic, we show that GATA1 protein expression is low in shRPS14 cells in which ribosome quantities are diminished. Here, we investigated the cause of low GATA1 protein expression in limiting ribosome availability. A global analysis of translation in RPs deficiencies highlights the rules that drive translation selectivity. We demonstrate that in addition of the transcript length, a high codon adaptation index (CAI) and a highly structured 3’UTR are the key characteristics for a selective translation. An integrated analysis of transcriptome and proteome confirms that the post-transcriptional regulations of gene expression are directly linked to the criteria governing the translational selectivity. In particular, these criteria explain GATA1 translation default with unprecedented precision.

Although most core clock factors are transcription factors, post-transcriptional control introduces delays that are critical for circadian oscillations. Little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock. We found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mRNAs does not arise from regulated translation. Nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mRNAs and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on non-cycling mRNAs. Most cyclically transcribed RNAs are translated at one of two major times in a 24h day, while rhythmic translation of most non-cyclic RNAs is phased to a single time of day. Unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs, suggesting circadian coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56924	Ribosome profiling reveals an important role for translational control in circadian gene expression.

ISRIB renders cells resistant to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances long-term memory in rodents (10.7554/eLife.00498). Here we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2α and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. eIF2α phosphorylation-induced stress granule (SG) formation was blocked by ISRIB. Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool. Restoration of mRNA translation and modulation of SG dynamics may be an effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by eIF2α phosphorylation, SG formation and cognitive loss.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65778	The small molecule ISRIB reverses the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation on translation and stress granule assembly.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05033	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.05033}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA274997	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA274997	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP053402

Clinical courses are highly variable, ranging from spontaneous regression/maturation to rapid progression despite intensive multimodal therapy. The estimation of 5-year event free survival in high-risk patients of only about 40 % stresses an importance of novel therapeutic strategies. A number of iron chelators have demonstrated marked in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity and are currently being developed as novel anti-cancer agents. Therefore, the potential antitumor effect of iron chelators in NB cancer was investigated. Among the compounds tested, ciclopirox olamine (CPX) was shown to be one of the most effective intracellular iron chelators in NB cells. To unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CPX on viability of NB cells, microarray analysis was performed in CHP134 control cells and cells treated with 5 µM CPX for 90 minutes. Inclusion of both total RNA (reflecting transcriptional status of the cells) and polysomal RNA (approximating the proteomic representation of the cells) provided us with a deeper understanding of changes in the cells upon CPX treatment.

Our studies reveals the wide distribution of circRNAs among the subcellular fractions except the mitochondria. Further comparative analysis indicate the differential subcellular distributions in expression, length, GC content, classification, alternative circularization and function of the parental genes. Through analyzing the binding motifs distribution of the transport-related RBPs among the subcellular circRNAs, we found that the different subcellular distribution characteristics of circRNAs might be resulted from the RBP-mediated selective transportation. It also implies that the circRNAs may follow the same transportation mechanism as linear RNAs: the RBPs specially recognize, bind to and transport the RNAs with the corresponding binding motifs, regardless of circular or linear RNAs. Our researches not only facilitate better understanding of the life history and molecular behavior of circRNA in cell, but also contribute to the exploration for new biological functions of circRNA.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107169	Circular RNA profiling provides insights into their subcellular distribution and molecular characteristics in HepG2 cells.

GSE68219	Homo sapiens	21	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL11154	MYC is a major determinant of mitotic cell fate	2015-04-23	Purpose: To determine global gene expression changes following siRNA knockdown of Myc, Kcnk1, and Snta1 compared to non-targeting siRNAs or mock-transfected cells Methods: Total RNA was processed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol. Generated cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer with four biological replicates sequenced per condition using single read, 50 cycle runs. Quality of sequencing reads were assessed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics) and then aligned to a reference genome (hg19, UCSC Genome Browser) using TopHat. Sequencing yielded, on average, 23.7 million unique reads per sample with a 60.7 - 65.7% mapping rate. Cufflinks was used to generate transcript abundance for each annotated protein-coding gene as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM), and statistical analysis and comparison of FPKM values was calculated using R (Bioconductor). Results: Fold changes comparing mock and a non-targeting siRNA were highly congruent. Myc RNAi induced numerous changes, with 955 downregulated genes and 1214 upregulated genes. The effect on Myc itself was relatively modest, possibly reflecting its ability to negatively auto-regulate its own expression. Gene ontology analysis highlighted ribosome biogenesis, metabolism, gene expression, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways, consistent with known Myc functions. The Kcnk1 siRNA affected 424 genes, with KCNK1 itself one of the most repressed. While gene ontology analysis also highlighted metabolism and biosynthesis pathways, the p-values and fold enrichment scores were substantially lower, indicating that DiM can be suppressed without major effects on metabolism and biosynthesis pathways. The Snta1 siRNA deregulated 575 genes, with SNTA1 itself the most repressed gene. Cell cycle and mitosis-related gene ontology terms feature heavily, consistent with this siRNA accelerating mitotic exit. Interestingly, FoxM1, which drives G2/M gene expression was reduced 1.75-fold, indicating that this siRNA may disrupt mitotic controls by deregulating FoxM1. Conclusions: Global gene expression profiling identifies Egr1 as regulator of mitotic cell fate.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68219	MYC Is a Major Determinant of Mitotic Cell Fate.

Short peptides (< 100 aa) have emerged as important regulators of development and physiology, but their identification has been limited by their size. We have leveraged the periodicity of ribosome movement on the mRNA to define actively translated ORFs by ribosome footprinting. This approach identifies several hundred translated small ORFs in zebrafish and human. Computational prediction of small ORFs from codon conservation patterns corroborates and extends these findings and identifies conserved sequences in zebrafish and human, suggesting functional peptide products (micropeptides).

The coupling of ribosomes to receptors has been proposed as a mechanism linking signals to local translation but it is not known how broadly this mechanism operates, nor whether it can selectively regulate mRNA translation. We report that receptor-ribosome coupling is employed by multiple guidance cue receptors and this interaction is mRNA-dependent. We find that different receptors bind to distinct sets of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Cue stimulation induces rapid dissociation of ribosomes from receptors and the selective translation of receptor-specific mRNAs in retinal axon growth cones. Further, we show that receptor-ribosome dissociation and cue-induced selective translation are inhibited by simultaneous exposure to translation-repressive cues, suggesting a novel mode of signal integration. Our findings reveal receptor-specific interactomes and provide a general model for the rapid, localized and selective control of cue-induced translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135338	Receptor-specific interactome as a hub for rapid cue-induced selective translation in axons.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48718	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.48718}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA558460	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA558460	None

In mammals, these hair cells lack the capacity for regeneration. Unlike mammals, hair cells from non-mammalian vertebrates, such as birds, can be regenerated throughout the life of the organism making them a useful model for studying inner ear genetics pathways. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA3 is required for inner ear development and mutations cause sensory neural deafness in humans. In the avian cochlea GATA3 is expressed throughout the sensory epithelia; however, expression is limited to the striola of the utricle. The striola corresponds to an abrupt change in morphologically distinct hair cell types and a 180° shift in hair cell orientation. We used 3 complimentary approaches to identify potential downstream targets of GATA3 in the avian utricle. Specifically we used microarray expression profiling of GATA3 knockdown by siRNA and GATA3 over-expression treatments as well as direct comparisons of GATA3 expressing cells from the striola and non GATA3 expressing cells from the extra-striola.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14784	Downstream targets of GATA3 in the vestibular sensory organs of the inner ear.

GSE148636	Homo sapiens	16	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL20301	Dual targeting of DDX3 and eIF4A by the translation inhibitor rocaglamide A	2020-04-14	Small molecule compounds that sense the nucleic acid sequences, promise the attractive venue for drug development. Such an unusual effect has been observed in the natural product Rocaglamide A (RocA) from Aglaia plant, proving to exhibit anti-tumor effects by clamping eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A onto mRNA polypurine sequences. Although eIF4A has been speculated the unique target of RocA, the insensitization of eIF4A in human cells only partially rescued the translation repression from RocA, suggesting another alternative target of this compound. Here, we revealed that DDX3 is an alternative target of RocA. Developing a RocA derivative with an O-nitrobenzoxadiazole unit (RocA-O-NBD), which can covalently bind to proximate proteins and provide fluorescence to them, we identified DDX3 bound to RocA. As observed in eIF4A, RocA locked the DDX3 protein onto polypurine sequences of RNA in an ATP-independent manner. De novo assembled Aglaia plant transcriptome uncovered the natural amino acid substitutions in Aglaia DDX3 to protect itself from RocA toxicity. Because of the dominant negative effect of RocA, we also proved the protein abundance of eIF4A and DDX3 in cancer cells determines their sensitivity to RocA. Overall, this study discovered DDX3 as another target of RocA and suggests the probability to predict tumor toxicity of RocA by the target abundance.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148636	Dual targeting of DDX3 and eIF4A by the translation inhibitor rocaglamide A.

GSE175554	Drosophila melanogaster	10	Other	GPL13304	Integrative genome-wide analysis of dopaminergic neuron-specific PARIS expression dissects recognition of multiple PPAR-γ associated gene regulation (TRAP-Seq).	2021-05-25	PURPOSE: The transcriptional repressor PARIS (ZNF746) was initially identified as a pathogenic co-substrate of PINK1 and parkin that leads to Parkinson’s disease (PD) by disrupting mitochondrial biogenesis through PPARγ coactivator -1α (PGC-1α) suppression. Later, accumulation of PARIS in dopamine (DA) neurons that cause neurotoxicity has been studied widely and growing evidence has linked defective mitochondrial biogenesis to PD pathogenesis. Yet, the mechanistic underpinnings of this link remain elusive. METHODS: We employed translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) followed by RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) for transcriptome profiling of DA neurons in transgenic Drosophila lines we generated expressing human PARIS or human PARIS mutant (C571A). Together with TRAP control and whole brain samples, this data set is composed of a total of 10 (3, 3, 3, and 1 respectively) replicate samples representing 4 different treatment groups for a set of gene-level (a parametric F-test) and transcript-level (a Wald test or a likelihood ratio test) differential expression analysis. RESULTS: Firstly, we identified differentially expressed genes by human PARIS in fly DA neurons successfully. Then, we showed that PPARγ acts as a master regulator of transcriptomic changes induced by PARIS in the clusters of Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. Also, we validated this finding in human neuroblastoma cell line. CONCLUSION: PPARγ plays a crucial regulatory role in PARIS phenotype. Drosophila models of PARIS-induced neurodegeneration used in this work to represent PD phenotype and our TRAP-seq protocol serve as a paradigm for future studies to unravel mechanistic underpinnings of PARIS biology.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE175554	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA732783	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA732783	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP321450

Here, we show that a pseudouridine-driven posttranscriptional program steers translation control to impact stem cell commitment during early embryogenesis. Mechanistically, the pseudouridine ‘writer’ PUS7 modifies and activates a network of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) targeting the translation initiation complex. PUS7 inactivation in embryonic stem cells impairs tRF-mediated translational regulation leading to high protein biosynthesis and abnormal germ layer specification. Dysregulation of PUS7 and tRFs in myeloid malignancies associates with altered translation rates, suggesting a role of pseudouridine in tumorigenesis. Our findings unveil a critical function of pseudouridine in directing translational control in stem cells with promisingly broad implications for human disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE101485	Pseudouridylation of tRNA-Derived Fragments Steers Translational Control in Stem Cells.

GSE133315	Homo sapiens	2	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL18573	C6orf203 is an RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis	2019-06-25	In all biological systems, RNAs are associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), forming complexes that control gene regulatory mechanisms, from RNA synthesis to decay. In mammalian mitochondria, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is conducted by mitochondrial RBPs (mt-RBPs) at various stages of mt-RNA metabolism, including polycistronic transcript production, its processing into individual transcripts, mt-RNA modifications, stability, translation, and degradation. To date, only a handful of mt-RBPs have been characterized. Here, we describe a putative human mitochondrial protein, C6orf203, that contains an S4-like domain - an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding domain previously identified in proteins involved in translation. Our data show C6orf203 to bind highly-structured RNA in vitro and associate with the mitoribosomal large subunit in HEK293T cells. Knockout of C6orf203 leads to a decrease in mitochondrial translation and consequent OXPHOS deficiency, without affecting mitochondrial RNA levels. Although mitoribosome stability is not affected in C6orf203-depleted cells, mitoribosome profiling analysis revealed a global disruption of the association of mt-mRNAs with the mitoribosome, suggesting that C6orf203 may be required for the proper maturation and functioning of the mitoribosome. We therefore propose C6orf203 to be a novel RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial translation, expanding the repertoire of factors engaged in this process.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133315	C6orf203 is an RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis.

Here, we extend the global steady-state measurements to additional mammalian contexts and find that regardless of the miRNA, cell type, growth condition, or translational state, mRNA destabilization explains most (66%–>90%) miRNA-mediated repression. We also determine the relative dynamics of translational repression and mRNA destabilization for endogenous mRNAs as a miRNA is induced. Although translational repression occurs rapidly, its effect is relatively weak, such that by the time consequential repression ensues, the effect of mRNA destabilization dominates. These results imply that consequential miRNA-mediated repression is largely irreversible and provide other insights into the nature of miRNA-mediated regulation. They also simplify future studies, dramatically extending the known contexts and time points for which monitoring mRNA changes captures most of the direct miRNA effects.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60426	mRNA destabilization is the dominant effect of mammalian microRNAs by the time substantial repression ensues.

Fat-specific knockout of HuR significantly enhances adipogenic gene program in all three major adipose tissues including epidydimal, inguinal white and brown adipose tissue, accompanied with systemic glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of HuR in adipose tissue prevents the HFD induced obesity by repressing adipogenesis. Mechanistically, HuR may inhibit adipogenesis by recognizing and modulating the stability of hundreds of adipocyte transcripts, including the mRNA of Insig1, a negative regulator during adipogenesis. Taken together, our work establishes HuR as a novel posttranscriptional regulator of adipogenesis and provides a new insight into how RNA processing contributes to adipocyte development.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE124279	The RNA-binding protein HuR is a negative regulator in adipogenesis.

In particular, non-neuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (AR low CRPC) is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The mechanisms that promote this phenotype remain poorly understood. Through molecular studies of murine and human models of AR low CRPC, we have identified a new functional interface between the androgen receptor and the translation initiation complex inhibitor 4EBP1. AR directly regulates 4EBP1 expression which translationally represses eIF4F complex formation and a pro-proliferation program. In the context of AR low prostate cancer, de-repression of translation initiation drives the aberrant expression of the pro-proliferation regulon which fuels uncontrolled cell growth. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream eIF4F translation initiation complex reverses the proliferation phenotype in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal a new previously unrecognized druggable nexus which functionally link the processes of mRNA transcription and translation initiation in a rapidly emerging class of advanced lethal prostate cancer	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116082	The androgen receptor regulates a druggable translational regulon in advanced prostate cancer.

Despite of considerable advance in molecular classification of GBMs, no improvements in therapy have been described. The scenario is further complicated by tumor heterogeneity and the relationship among genetic, transcriptional and functional findings. Classically, gene expression has been evaluated by steady-state mRNA, however, this does not take translational control into consideration, which contributes considerably to the composition of the proteome. In this study, we evaluated the transcriptomic and translatomic signature of a GBM obtained from a single patient focusing in tumor heterogeneity. In a sampling of eight fragments, we investigated the translation rates, mTORC1 and ERK1/2 pathways and identified both total and polysome associated mRNAs. An increased translation rate was observed in fragments with high-grade histological features. High-grade histology was also associated with the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis, in both transcriptomes and translatomes. However, genes associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stress response, were observed only in translatomes from high-grade fragments. Overall, our results demonstrate that isolation of translated mRNA can be used to identify biomarkers and reveal previously unrecognized determinants of heterogeneity in GBMs.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130220	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA534298	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA534298	None

In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5' UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause-relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhanced upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript where this resulted in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced usage of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons. Thus, we propose that eIF5A functions not only to maintain efficient translation elongation in eukaryotic cells, but also to maintain the fidelity of translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132009	Suppression of Ribosomal Pausing by eIF5A Is Necessary to Maintain the Fidelity of Start Codon Selection.

The unstructured N-terminal tail (NTT) of yeast eIF1A deploys five basic residues to contact tRNAi, mRNA, or 18S rRNA exclusively in the closed state. Interestingly, EIF1AX mutations altering the human eIF1A NTT are associated with uveal melanoma (UM). We found that substituting all five basic residues, and seven UM-associated substitutions, in yeast eIF1A suppresses initiation at near-cognate UUG codons and AUGs in poor context. Ribosome profiling of NTT substitution R13P reveals heightened discrimination against unfavorable AUG context genome-wide. Both R13P and K16D substitutions destabilize the closed complex at UUG codons in reconstituted PICs. Thus, electrostatic interactions involving the eIF1A NTT stabilize the closed conformation and promote utilization of suboptimal start codons. We predict UM-associated mutations alter human gene expression by increasing discrimination against poor initiation sites.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE108334	eIF1A residues implicated in cancer stabilize translation preinitiation complexes and favor suboptimal initiation sites in yeast.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31250	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.31250}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA423281	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA423281	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP127274

Dysfunction or death of rod photoreceptors precedes cone loss in many retinal and macular degenerative diseases, suggesting a rod-dependent trophic support for cone survival. Rod differentiation and homeostasis are dependent on the basic motif leucine zipper transcription factor NRL. The loss of Nrl in mice (Nrl-/-) results in a retina with predominantly S-opsin containing cones that exhibit molecular and functional characteristics of WT cones. Here we report that Nrl-/- retina undergoes a rapid but transient period of degeneration in early adulthood, with cone apoptosis, retinal detachment, alterations in retinal vessel structure, and activation and translocation of retinal microglia. However, cone degeneration stabilizes by four months of age, resulting in a thinned but intact outer nuclear layer with residual cones expressing S- and M-opsins and a preserved photopic ERG. At this stage, microglia translocate back to the inner retina and reacquire a quiescent morphology. Gene profiling analysis during the period of transient degeneration reveals misregulation of stress response and inflammation genes, implying their involvement in cone death. The Nrl-/- retina illustrates the long-term viability of cones in the absence of rods and may serve as a model for elucidating mechanisms of cone homeostasis and degeneration that would be relevant to understanding diseases of the cone-dominant human macula.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE33674	Preservation of cone photoreceptors after a rapid yet transient degeneration and remodeling in cone-only Nrl-/- mouse retina.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71893	AKT Inhibition Promotes Nonautonomous Cancer Cell Survival.

The normal function of DDX3X is poorly understood, and the consequences of its cancer-associated mutations have not been explored. Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation–high-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5’ bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59094	Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.

We identified METTL3 as an essential gene for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell growth in two distinct genetic screens. Down-regulation of METTL3 results in cell cycle arrest, differentiation of leukemic cells and failure to establish leukemia in immunodeficient mice. We show that METTL3, independently of METTL14, associates with chromatin and localizes to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of 83 active genes. The vast majority of these genes have a CAATT-box motif at their TSS, are occupied by a specific set of transcription factors including NFY, WDR5, KLF9 and they harbor specific histone modifications (e.g. H3R2me2s). Promoter bound METTL3 induces m6A modification within the coding region of the associated mRNA transcript and it enhances translation due to relief of ribosome stalling. We show that genes regulated by METTL3 in this way are necessary for AML-leukemia.

Clinical courses are highly variable, ranging from spontaneous regression/maturation to rapid progression despite intensive multimodal therapy. The estimation of 5-year event free survival in high-risk patients of only about 40 % stresses an importance of novel therapeutic strategies.

Overexpression of protein subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has been associated with increased translation of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation. In addition to playing a major role in general translation initiation by serving as a scaffold for the assembly of translation initiation complexes, eIF3 regulates translation of specific cellular mRNAs and viral RNAs. Mutations in the N-terminal Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) RNA-binding motif of the EIF3A subunit in eIF3 interfere with Hepatitis C Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) mediated translation initiation in vitro. Here we use RNA-seq and ribosome profiling of engineered lentiviral HEK293T cells to show that the EIF3A HLH motif controls translation of a small set of cellular transcripts enriched in oncogenic mRNAs, including MYC.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118239	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA484941	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA484941	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP156569

In addition to the internal m6A, N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of capped mRNAs in vertebrates. However, its biogenesis and functional role remain elusive. Using a reverse genetics approach, we identified PCIF1, a factor that interacts with the serine-5-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, as a cap-specific adenosine methyltransferase (CAPAM) responsible for N6-methylation of m6Am. The crystal structure of CAPAM in complex with substrates revealed the molecular basis of cap-specific m6A formation. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that N6-methylation of m6Am promotes the translation of capped mRNAs. Thus, a cap-specific m6A writer promotes translation of mRNAs starting from m6Am.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE122071	Cap-specific terminal <i>N</i> <sup>6</sup>-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II-associated methyltransferase.

Here, by analysing the rRNA 2’OMe in a large series of 195 human primary breast tumours using the RiboMETH-seq approach we have identified the positions within the rRNA molecules which can tolerate the absence of 2’OMe in humans. The frequency of rRNA 2’OMe at some positions is highly stable between individuals (termed “stable”) whereas it can vary substantially at other positions (termed “variant”). Differential association of rRNA 2’OMe with breast cancer features, evolution and structure/function characteristics suggest the stable positions showing a low inter-variability might be required to maintain the core structure and thus the function of the ribosome – representing compulsory rRNA 2’OMe positions. In contrast, the variant positions displaying high inter-variability might be the source of regulatory events – representing plastic rRNA 2’OMe positions. Therefore our data issued from rRNA 2’OMe profiling of a large-scale human sample series bring the first compelling evidence to resolve two divergent long lasting visions of the role of rRNA 2’O-Me and sustain the emerging role of the ribosome plasticity in regulating translation in cancer.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143415	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA600412	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA600412	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP241165

RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), the prototypical DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its mRNA selectivity is proposed to reflect highly structured 5′ UTRs that are very dependent on eIF4A-mediated unwinding. Here, we show that secondary structure in 5′ UTRs is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and RocA does not repress translation by reducing eIF4A activity. Rather, in vitro and in vivo, RocA clamps eIF4A onto a specific sequence motif even after ATP hydrolysis. This artificially clamped eIF4A blocks 43S scanning, leading to premature, upstream translation initiation and reducing gene expression on transcripts bearing the RocA-eIF4A target sequence. In elucidating the mechanism of this lead anti-cancer compound and explaining its mRNA selectivity, we provide the first example of a drug stabilizing sequence-specific RNA-protein interactions.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70211	Rocaglates convert DEAD-box protein eIF4A into a sequence-selective translational repressor.

Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3′ UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133393	Genome-wide Survey of Ribosome Collision.

While we did not find detectable ac4C sites in human and yeast mRNAs, ac4C was induced via ectopic overexpression of eukaryotic acetyltransferase complexes, invariably at a conserved sequence motif. In contrast, cross-evolutionary profiling reveals unprecedented levels of ac4C across hundreds of residues in rRNA, tRNA, ncRNA and mRNA from hyperthermophilic archaea. Ac4C is dramatically induced in response to temperature, and acetyltransferase-deficient archaeal strains exhibit temperature-dependent growth defects. Cryo-EM visualization of WT and acetyltransferase-deficient archaeal ribosomes furnishes structural insights into the temperature-dependent distribution of ac4C and its potential thermoadaptive role.

To accelerate our understanding of cis-regulatory code embedded in 5’UTR, we devised massively parallel reporter assays from a synthetic mRNA library composed of over one million 5’UTR variants. A completely randomized 10-nucleotide sequence preceding an upstream open reading frame (uORF) and downstream GFP leads to a broad range of mRNA translatability and stability in mammalian cells. While efficient translation protects mRNA from degradation, uORF translation triggers mRNA decay in a UPF1-dependent manner. We also identified translational inhibitory elements in 5’UTR with G-quadruplex as a mark for mRNA decay in the P-body. Unexpectedly, an unstructured A-rich element in 5’UTR, while enabling cap-independent translation, destabilizes mRNAs in the absence of translation. Our results not only expose diverse sequence features of 5’UTR in controlling mRNA translatability, but also reveal ribosome-dependent and -independent mRNA surveillance pathways.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145046	Decoding mRNA translatability and stability from the 5' UTR.

Here we report the ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells and brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs), which leads to the identification of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) as a CSC- specific determinant. We confirmed that GPD1 is expressed in BTSCs but not in neural stem cells. Intriguingly, expression of GPD1 is only found in the infiltrating dormant BTSCs in vivo and these cells start to divide and drive tumour relapse after chemotherapy. Most importantly, inhibition of GPD1 expression in tumour-bearing mice leads to prolonged survival. Further analysis shows that loss of GPD1 results in widespread changes in important pathways affecting BTSC maintenance. Human patient data analysis suggests that GPD1 is expressed in the dormant infiltrating tumour cells in human glioblastoma and the expression level is associated with a worse prognosis. This study provides an attractive therapeutic target for treating brain tumours and a novel aspect of regulation of CSC dormancy.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110867	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA434717	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA434717	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP133176

Here, we analyze translation in primary human reticulocytes and platelets by ribosome profiling and uncover dramatic accumulation of post-termination, unrecycled ribosomes in the 3´UTRs of mRNAs. We then demonstrate that these ribosomes accumulate as a result of the natural loss of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 during terminal differentiation. We find that induction of ribosome rescue factors PELO and HBS1L is required to maintain translational homeostasis when ABCE1 levels fall. This activation of ribosome rescue mitigates the effects of ribosome shortage on translational output, including on hemoglobin production. Our observations suggest that this distinctive loss of ABCE1 in anucleate blood lineages sensitizes them to defects in ribosome homeostasis and that activation of a ribosome rescue pathway plays a lineage-specific role in maintaining ribosome homeostasis during blood cell development.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85864	Dynamic Regulation of a Ribosome Rescue Pathway in Erythroid Cells and Platelets.

Low amino acids activate the eIF2α kinase GCN2 through binding of uncharged tRNAs to a histidyl-tRNA synthetase−related regulatory domain. Once activated GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2α, inhibiting ternary complex formation and translation initiation. Recent studies show that mTORC1 is particularly sensitive to arginine and leucine status, with a deprivation of these amino acids leading to a strong inhibition of mTORC1 that prevents the phosphorylation and inactivation of the translational repressor 4EBP1. Though amino acids are known regulators of translation, the effects that deficiencies of specific amino acids have on translation have yet to be determined. We demonstrate that deprivation of leucine or methionine results in large inhibitory effects on translation initiation and on polysome formation that are not replicated by overexpressing non-phosphorylatable 4EBP1 or a phosphomimetic eIF2α. Our results demonstrate that a lack of either leucine or methionine has a major impact on mRNA translation, though they act by quite different mechanisms. Leucine deprivation appears to primarily inhibit ribosome loading, whereas methionine deprivation appears to primarily impair start site recognition. These data point to a unique regulatory effect that methionine status has on translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112643	Effects of single amino acid deficiency on mRNA translation are markedly different for methionine versus leucine.

A common source of aberrant mRNAs is premature polyadenylation, which can result in non-functional protein products. Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) sequences are terminally stalled, followed by ribosome recycling and rapid decay of the truncated nascent polypeptide via the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). Here, we demonstrate that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at continuous A-tracts during RQC. Using individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), we show that MKRN1 is positioned upstream of A-rich stretches and poly(A) tails in mRNAs through an interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Ubiquitin remnant profiling uncovered PABP and ribosomal protein RPS10 as well as additional translational regulators as main substrates of MRKN1.

GSE22871	Mus musculus	30	Expression profiling by array	GPL1261	Expression data from wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)	2010-07-09	Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) and a persistent environmental contaminant found in the tissues of humans and wildlife. Although blood levels of PFOS have begun to decline, health concerns remain because of the long half-life of PFOS in humans. Like other PFAAs, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS is an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) and exhibits hepatocarcinogenic potential in rodents. PFOS is also a developmental toxicant in rodents where, unlike PFOA, it’s mode of action is independent of PPARα. Wild-type (WT) and PPARα-null (Null) mice were dosed with 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day PFOS for 7 days. Animals were euthanized, livers weighed, and liver samples collected for histology and preparation of total RNA. Gene profiling was conducted using Affymetrix 430_2 microarrays. In WT mice, PFOS induced changes that were characteristic of PPARα transactivation including regulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis, proteasome activation, and inflammation. PPARα-independent changes were indicated in both WT and Null mice by altered expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and xenobiotic metabolism. Such results are similar to prior studies done with PFOA and are consistent with modest activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and possibly PPARγ and/or PPARβ/δ. Unique treatment-related effects were also found in Null mice including altered expression of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis. Of interest was up-regulation of Cyp7a1, a gene which is under the control of various transcription regulators. Hence, in addition to its ability to modestly activate PPARα, PFOS induces a variety of “off-target” effects as well.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22871	Gene Expression Profiling in Wild-Type and PPARα-Null Mice Exposed to Perfluorooctane Sulfonate Reveals PPARα-Independent Effects.

These cellular processes are important for evading the initiation of carcinogenesis in skin. We previously showed that repression of mRNA translation initiation through phosphorylation of eIF2α (eIF2α-P) protects keratinocytes from UVB-induced apoptosis. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism of eIF2α-P cytoprotection in response to UVB. Loss of eIF2α-P induced by UVB diminished G1 arrest, DNA repair rate, and cellular senescence coincident with enhanced cell death in human keratinocytes. Genome-wide translation analyses revealed that the mechanism for these critical changes directed by eIF2α-P involved induced expression of CDKN1A encoding p21 protein. p21 is a major regulator of the cell cycle, and we show that human CDKN1A mRNA splice variant 4 is preferentially translated by eIF2α-P during stress in a mechanism mediated in part by upstream ORFs situated in the 5’-leader of CDKN1A mRNA. We conclude that eIF2α-P is cytoprotective in response to UVB by a mechanism featuring translation of a specific splice variant of CDKN1A that facilitates G1 arrest and subsequent DNA repair.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99745	Translational control of a human <i>CDKN1A</i> mRNA splice variant regulates the fate of UVB-irradiated human keratinocytes.

Functional characterization of the encoded microproteins reveals distinct cellular localizations, specific protein binding partners, and hundreds that are presented by the HLA system.

As a model system we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line clinical treatment. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes following bortezomib treatment. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of changes at the transcriptional level. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. As suggested by these data, we find that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic response regulator HSF1 promotes cell death by bortezomib. Thus, monitoring global cellular dynamics after chemotherapy offers in-depth insight into apoptosis and can also guide potential therapeutic combinations.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48785	Global cellular response to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01236	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.01236}	'polyA RNA', 'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA211752	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA211752	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP027015

The normal function of DDX3X is poorly understood, and the consequences of its cancer-associated mutations have not been explored. Here we used genomic, biochemical, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches to investigate normal DDX3X function and the impact of cancer-associated DDX3X mutations. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation–high-throughput sequencing (CLIPseq) analyses revealed that DDX3X binds primarily to ~1000 mature mRNA targets at binding sites spanning the full mRNA length; their enrichment in the coding regions suggests that DDX3X plays a role in translational elongation. The association of wild-type DDX3X with polysomes is consistent with this observation. Cancer-associated mutations result in loss of DDX3X from polysomes and accumulation of mutant DDX3X in stress granules (cytoplasmic accumulations of translationally arrested mRNAs). Mutation-dependent redistribution of DDX3X to stress granules is also observed in a Drosophila model system and in MB tumor cells from patients carrying DDX3X mutations. Importantly, mRNAs targeted by DDX3X are enriched in translation factors, suggesting that DDX3X regulates translation both directly and indirectly. Indeed, depletion of DDX3X by RNAi or over-expression of mutant DDX3X significantly impairs global protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling confirmed this observation and showed a 5’ bias in ribosomal occupancy, further confirming the role of DDX3X in translational elongation. Together, our data show that DDX3X is a key regulator of translation and that this function is impaired by cancer-associated mutations. Finally, we found that medulloblastoma-related mutant DDX3X can efficiently bind the wild-type form suggesting that mutant DDX3X could exert a dominant negative effect in vivo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59093	Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.

RocA converts its molecular target, translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), a DEAD-box protein, into a purine-selective RNA-binding protein that represses protein synthesis from a subset of mRNAs. This unusual mechanism of action raises the question of how the drug induces selectivity for polypurine sequences. Furthermore, as eIF4A is found in all eukaryotes, it is unclear how Aglaia resists the effects of RocA. Here, we assembled the Aglaia transcriptome de novo and identified highly specific mutations in eIF4A that enable it to evade RocA-dependent translation inhibition. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the human eIF4A1•ATP analog•RocA•polypurine RNA complex. RocA binds residues mutated in Aglaia and intercalates between consecutive purines at a sharp RNA bend, revealing the structural basis of polypurine-selective translational inhibition by RocA in human and resistance in Aglaia.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102720	The Translation Inhibitor Rocaglamide Targets a Bimolecular Cavity between eIF4A and Polypurine RNA.

Here, we treat cancer cells with sub-therapeutic doses of Akti-1/2, an allosteric small molecule AKT inhibitor, in order to experimentally model pharmacologic inhibition of AKT signaling in vitro. We then apply a combined RNA, protein, and metabolite profiling approach to develop an integrated, multi-scale, molecular snapshot of this “AKTlow” cancer cell state. We find that AKT-inhibited cancer cells suppress thousands of mRNA transcripts, and proteins related to the cell cycle, ribosome, and protein translation. Surprisingly, however, these AKT-inhibited cells simultaneously up-regulate a host of other proteins and metabolites post-transcriptionally, reflecting activation of their endo-vesiculo-membrane system, secretion of inflammatory proteins, and elaboration of extracellular microvesicles. Importantly, these microvesicles enable rapidly proliferating cancer cells of various types to better withstand different stress conditions, including serum deprivation, hypoxia, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro and xenografting in vivo. These findings suggest a model whereby cancer cells experiencing a partial inhibition of AKT signaling may actually promote the survival of neighbors through non-cell autonomous communication.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71892	AKT Inhibition Promotes Nonautonomous Cancer Cell Survival.

Nevertheless, how non-AUG translation is regulated differently from canonical translation is poorly understood. We thus used start codon-selective reporters and ribosome profiling to characterize how translation from non-AUG start codons responds to protein synthesis inhibitors in human cells. These analyses surprisingly revealed that translation of non-AUG reporters and the endogenous GUG-encoded DAP5 (eIF4G2/p97) mRNA are resistant to cycloheximide (CHX), a translation inhibitor which slows but does not completely abrogate elongation. Our data suggest that slowly elongating ribosomes cause queuing of scanning pre-initiation complexes (PIC), preferentially enhancing otherwise poor recognition of non-AUG start codons. Consistent with this model, limiting PIC formation or scanning sensitizes non-AUG translation to CHX. Moreover, PIC queuing can cause translation from an AUG codon in a poor context to become less sensitive to CHX. We further find that non-AUG translation is resistant to other inhibitors that target ribosomes within the coding sequence, but not those targeting newly initiated ribosomes. In total, these data indicate that ribosome queuing enables mRNAs with poor initiation context, namely those from non-AUG start codons, to be resistant to pharmacological inhibitors.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE125086	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA515197	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA515197	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP179458

We found that IFN-g regulates macrophage metabolism and translation in an integrated manner by targeting mTORC1 and MNK pathways that converge on the selective regulator of translation initiation eIF4E. Physiological downregulation of the central metabolic regulator mTORC1 by IFN-g was associated with autophagy and translational suppression of repressors of inflammation such as HES1. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in TLR2-stimulated macrophages revealed that IFN-g selectively modulates the macrophage translatome to promote inflammation, further reprogram metabolic pathways, and modulate protein synthesis. These results add IFN-g-mediated metabolic reprogramming and translational regulation as key components of classical inflammatory macrophage activation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66809	Interferon-γ regulates cellular metabolism and mRNA translation to potentiate macrophage activation.

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (≥84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.

The human fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) responds to environmental or host temperature by initiating unique transcriptional programs to specify multicellular (hyphae) or unicellular (yeast) developmental states that function in infectivity or pathogenesis, respectively. Here we used recent advances in next-generation sequencing to uncover a novel post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation in Hc developmental cell types. We found that ~2% percent of Hc transcripts exhibit 5’ leader sequences that differ markedly in length between morphogenetic states. Ribosome density and mRNA abundance measurements uncovered a class of differential leader transcripts that exhibit tight transcriptional and translational regulation. Further examination of these dually regulated genes revealed that some control Hc morphology and that their strict regulation is necessary for the pathogen to make appropriate developmental decisions in response to temperature. This series contains expression profiling data for four strains of Hc.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68706	Genome-Wide Reprogramming of Transcript Architecture by Temperature Specifies the Developmental States of the Human Pathogen Histoplasma.

The mechanisms by which environmental toxicants alter developmental processes predisposing individuals to chronic disease are not understood. arsenic exposure via drinking water causes cancer and cardiovascular disease. Transplacental arsenic exposure accelerates and exacerbates atherosclerosis in ApoE-knockout mice. The liver plays a central role in the interlinked diseases diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. The hypothesis that accelerated atherosclerosis is a consequence of altered hepatic development was investigated by microarray profiling of mRNA and microRNA abundance in livers isolated from 10 week old (PND70) and newborn (PND1) mice exposed or not exposed to arsenic from day 8 post-fertilization to birth. The results show that arsenic exposure alters the trajectory of both mRNA and microRNA expression as mice age. A 51-gene signature of arsenic exposure in both PND1 and PND70 mice was identified. Pathway Architect analysis of this signature identified nodes of interaction including Hspa8, IgM and Hnf4a. Gene ontology analysis of arsenic exposure-altered mRNAs indicated that pathways for gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were suppressed in PND1 mice and pathways for protein export, ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, and complement and coagulation cascades were induced in PND70 mice. Analysis of promoters of differentially expressed genes identified enriched transcription factor binding sites and cluster analyses revealed groups of genes sharing sets of transcription factor binding sites suggesting common regulation. Srebp1 binding sites are present in ~1/6 of the genes differentially expressed in PND70 livers. Western blot analyses of PND70 liver proteins showed that the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hspa1, Hsp70) and the active form of Srebp1 were induced in arsenic-exposed mice as were plasma AST and ALT levels.

Methods: Tissue homogenates were prepared from frozen sections of a muscle biopsy obtained from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA dystrophin mutation and a normal control. Ribosome-protected fragments and total RNA were prepared from a single homogenate, so starting RNA populations for both libraries were closely matched. Homogenates were not clarified before RNase digestion to avoid loss of ribosomes associated with large molecular weight complexes and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared after rRNA subtraction to avoid positional loss of 5’ reads. RPF-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and RNA-Seq libraries were built using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit (Illumina). RPF-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries were subjected to 50 cycles of single-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. Trimmed and filtered RPF- and RNA-Seq reads were mapped to RefSeq fasta sequences downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (hg19 assembly). Results: Most mutations that truncate the reading frame of the DMD gene result in loss of dystrophin expression and lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, amelioration of disease severity can result from alternate translation initiation beginning in DMD exon 6 that results in the expression of a highly functional N-truncated dystrophin. This novel isoform results from usage of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within exon 5 that is glucocorticoid-inducible. IRES activity is confirmed in patient muscle by both peptide sequencing and ribosomal profiling. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular explanation for the rescue of 5’ truncating mutations via a heretofore undescribed mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of dystrophin expression. The presence of a glucocorticoid-inducible IRES within a highly conserved region of the DMD sequence strongly suggests a programmed role for alternate translation initiation, and ongoing efforts to understand the relevant cell lineage-specific and/or conditional activation signals will shed light on underlying mechanisms of IRES control and elucidate potentially novel functions of dystrophin.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56148	Translation from a DMD exon 5 IRES results in a functional dystrophin isoform that attenuates dystrophinopathy in humans and mice.

Using these profiles we generated molecular signatures for each of these cell types, proved that the molecular identity of these cell types is very well conserved across mouse and humans, and constructed functional networks for each cell type that allowed us to identify genes and pathways associated with selective neuronal vulnerability in AD.

This revealed multiple quantitative insights. First, the genomic profiles of the three parameters are systematically different in key statistical features. Sequentially more genes exhibit extreme low or high expression values from TR to RA, then to TA. That is, because of cellular coordination of these regulatory mechanisms, sequentially higher levels of gene expression selectivity are achieved as genetic information flow from the genome to the proteome. Second, the contribution of the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism to the cellular coordination process was assessed. The data enabled an estimation of mRNA stability, revealing a moderate but significant positive correlation between the estimated mRNA stability and translation activity. Third, the proportion of a mRNA occupied by un-translated regions (UTR) exhibits a negative relationship with the level of this correlation, and is thus a major determinant of the mode of regulation of the mRNA. High-UTR-proportion mRNAs tend to defy the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism, staying out of the polysome but remaining stable; mRNAs with little UTRs largely follow this regulation. In summary, we quantitatively delineated the relationship among multiple transcriptome regulation parameters, i.e., cellular coordination of corresponding regulatory mechanisms.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111222	A Multi-Parameter Analysis of Cellular Coordination of Major Transcriptome Regulation Mechanisms.

These viruses utilize an 11kb RNA genome for translation and replication, and much remains to be learnt about how the entire genome folds to enable virus function. Here, we performed high throughput RNA secondary structure and pair-wise interaction mapping on four dengue serotypes and four Zika strains within their virus particles. We identified structures that are associated with translation pausing, and are evolutionary conserved by integrating synonymous mutation rates into our analysis. Genome-wide interaction mapping revealed alternative structures, as well as extensive long-range RNA interactions – including the known circularization signals– within the virus particles. Many of these long-range interactions are conserved across the viruses and/or clustered into “hubs” that are shown to be functionally important.

Such readthrough events can be therapeutically desirable when a premature termination codon (PTC) is found in a critical gene. To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. Stop codon identity, the nucleotide following the stop codon, and the surrounding mRNA sequence context all influence the likelihood of SCR. In comparison to NTCs, downstream stop codons in 3′UTRs are recognized less efficiently by ribosomes, suggesting that targeting of critical stop codons for readthrough may be achievable without general disruption of translation termination. Finally, we find that G418 treatment globally alters gene expression with substantial effects on translation of histone genes, selenoprotein genes, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE138642	Stop codon context influences genome-wide stimulation of termination codon readthrough by aminoglycosides.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52611	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.52611}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576653	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA576653	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP224956

As part of their antiviral response, cells also trigger the translational shutoff response which prevents translation of viral mRNAs and cellular mRNAs in a non-selective manner. Intriguingly, mRNAs encoding for antiviral factors bypass this translational shutoff, suggesting the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms enabling expression of the self-defence genes. Here, we identified the dsRNA binding protein ILF3 as an essential host factor required for efficient translation of the central antiviral cytokine, IFNB1, and a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. By combining polysome profiling and next-generation sequencing, ILF3 was also found to be necessary to establish the dsRNA-induced transcriptional and translational programs. We propose a central role for the host factor ILF3 in enhancing expression of the antiviral defence mRNAs in cellular conditions where cap-dependent translation is compromised.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130595	ILF3 contributes to the establishment of the antiviral type I interferon program.

Here we find that mTORC1 controls a transcriptional program encoding amino acid transporters and metabolic enzymes through a mechanism also used to regulate protein synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of mTORC1-responsive mRNAs identified a promoter element recognized by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key effector of the integrated stress response. ATF4 translation is normally induced by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) through a mechanism that requires upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the ATF4 5' UTR. mTORC1 also controls ATF4 translation through uORFs, but independent of changes in eIF2α phosphorylation. mTORC1 instead employs the 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) family of translation repressors. These results link mTORC1-regulated demand for protein synthesis with an ATF4-regulated transcriptional program that controls the supply of amino acids to the translation machinery.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97384	mTORC1 Balances Cellular Amino Acid Supply with Demand for Protein Synthesis through Post-transcriptional Control of ATF4.

However, the role of translational regulation in modulating cellular protein content during mitosis remains poorly understood. Here, using ribosome profiling, we show that translational, rather than transcriptional regulation is the dominant mechanism for modulating protein synthesis at mitotic entry. The vast majority of regulated mRNAs are translationally repressed, which contrasts previous findings of selective mRNA translational activation at mitotic entry. One of the most pronounced translationally repressed genes in mitosis is Emi1, an inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), which is degraded during mitosis. We show that Emi1 degradation is insufficient for full APC activation and that simultaneous translational repression is required. These results provide a genome-wide view of protein translation during mitosis and suggest that translational repression may be used to ensure complete protein inactivation	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67902	Regulation of mRNA translation during mitosis.	eLife	7.551	https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07957	{eLife (7.551): 10.7554/eLife.07957}	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA281177	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA281177	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP057253

In response to oncogenic RAS signaling, the initiation pausing relaxes and contributes to the increased translational flux. Intriguingly, mRNA m6A modification in the vicinity of start codons influences the behavior of initiating ribosomes. Under oncogenic RAS signaling, the reduced mRNA methylation leads to relaxed initiation pausing, thereby promoting malignant transformation and tumor growth. Restored initiation pausing by inhibiting m6A demethylases suppresses RAS-mediated oncogenic translation and subsequent tumorigenesis. Our findings unveil a new paradigm of translational control that is co-opted by RAS mutant cancer cells to drive malignant phenotypes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159210	Relaxed initiation pausing of ribosomes drives oncogenic translation.

We compared differentially expressed genes derived from the analysis of the transcriptome and the translatome of HEK293T wild-type (WT) and XRN1-null cells by RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq, respectively. Two biological replicates of each cell line were analyzed. The RNA-Seq analysis indicated that a substantial fraction of the total 10,105 genes showed significant differences between the two cell lines. 2,906 genes were significantly upregulated whilst 2,900 genes were downregulated using a fold change >0 on log2 scale with an FDR<0.005 to determine abundance. Significantly fewer genes showed differences between the WT and the XRN1-null cells at the level of translation with 433 genes showing an increase in abundance of ribosomal footprints whilst 560 genes were decreased as indicated by the Ribo-Seq analysis.

Recently, ribosome profiling became the state-of-the-art method to quantitatively characterize translation dynamics at a transcriptome-wide level. However, the strategy of library generation affects its outcomes. Here, we present a modified ribosomeprofiling protocol starting from yeast, human cells and vertebrate brain tissue. We use a DNA linker carrying four randomized positions at its 5’ and a reverse-transcription (RT) primer with three randomized positions to reduce artifacts during library preparation. The use of seven randomized nucleotides allows to efficiently detect library-generation artifacts. We find that the effect of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts is relatively small for global analyses when sufficient input material is used. However, when input material is limiting, our strategy improves the sensitivity of gene-specific analyses. Furthermore, randomized nucleotides alleviate the skewed frequency of specific sequences at the 3’ end of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) likely resulting from ligase specificity. Finally, strategies that rely on dual ligation show a high degree of gene-coverage variation. Taken together, our approach helps to remedy two of the main problems associated with ribosome-profiling data. This will facilitate the analysis of translational dynamics and increase our understanding of the influence of RNA modifications on translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84746	Dual randomization of oligonucleotides to reduce the bias in ribosome-profiling libraries.

Twenty-two species of mitochondrial (mt-)tRNAs encoded in mtDNA are required to translate essential subunits of the respiratory chain complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. mt-tRNAs contain post-transcriptional modifications introduced by nuclear-encoded tRNA-modifying enzymes. These modifications are required for deciphering genetic code accurately, as well as stabilizing tRNA. Loss of tRNA modifications frequently results in severe pathological consequences. We performed a comprehensive analysis of post-transcriptional modifications of all human mt-tRNAs, including 14 previously-uncharacterized species, and revised the modification status of some of the previously studied species. In total, we found 17 kinds of RNA modifications at 137 positions (8.7% in 1,575 nucleobases) in 22 species of human mt-tRNAs. An up-to-date list of 34 genes responsible for human mt-tRNA modifications are provided. We here demonstrated that both QTRT1 and QTRT2 are required for biogenesis of queuosine (Q) at position 34 of four mt-tRNAs. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial decoding system, and could help to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of human mitochondrial diseases caused by aberrant tRNA modifications.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE150439	Complete chemical structures of human mitochondrial tRNAs.

RPLP1/2 function to enhance ribosome elongation at this position and increase viral protein stability, possibly by improving co-translational folding of DENV proteins. We also analyzed the effects of RPLP1/2 depletion on cellular translation. We find that RPLP1/2 moderately affects ribosome density for a small subset of cellular mRNAs. However, meta-analysis of ribosome positions on all cellular mRNAs revealed slightly increased accumulation of ribosomes downstream of start codons in RPLP1/2-depleted cells, suggesting that RPLP1/2 enhance elongation efficiency. Importantly, we found that ribosome density on mRNAs encoding multiple TMDs was disproportionately affected by RPLP1/2 knockdown, suggesting a role for RPLP1/2 in transmembrane protein biogenesis.

Although the deceleration of ribosome defines the fates of the mRNAs and the synthesizing proteins, fundamental questions remain to be addressed including where ribosomes pause in mRNAs, what kind of RNA/amino acid context causes the pausing, and how physiologically significant the slowdown of protein synthesis is. Here we surveyed the position of ribosome collisions, caused by ribosome pausing, at a genome-wide level using the modified ribosome profiling in human and zebrafish. The collided ribosomes, i.e. disome, emerge at various sites; the proline-proline-lysine motif, stop codons, and 3′ UTR. The number of ribosomes in a collision is not limited to two, rather four to five, forming a queue of ribosomes. Especially, XBP1, a key modulator of unfolded protein response, shows striking queues of collided ribosomes thus acts as a substrate for ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to avoid the accumulation of undesired proteins in the absence of stress. Our results provide an insight into the causes and the consequences of ribosome slowdowns by dissecting the specific architecture of ribosomes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140639	Genome-wide Survey of Ribosome Collision.

GSE49310	Candida albicans	96	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL15645	The Transcriptional Stress Response of Candida albicans to Weak Organic Acids	2013-07-29	Candida albicans is the most important fungal pathogen of humans, causing severe infections especially in nosocomial and immunocompromised settings. However, it is also the most prevalent fungus of the normal human microbiome, where it shares its habitat with hundreds of trillions of other microbial cells. Despite weak organic acids (WOAs) being among the most abundant metabolites produced by bacterial microbiota, little is known about their effect on C. albicans. Here we employed a sequencing-based profiling strategy to systematically investigate the transcriptional stress response of C. albicans to lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid at several time points after treatment. Our data reveal a complex transcriptional response, with individual WOAs triggering unique gene expression profiles and with important differences between acute and chronic exposure. In spite of all these dissimilarities, we found significant overlaps between the gene expression changes induced by each WOA, which lead us to uncover a core transcriptional signature that was unrelated to the general response to low pH. Genes commonly up-regulated by WOAs were enriched in several iron transporters, which was associated with an overall decrease in intracellular iron concentrations. Moreover, chronic exposure to any WOA lead to down-regulation of RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis genes, which resulted in significant reduction of total RNA levels in general and of ribosomal RNA in particular. In conclusion, this study suggests that GI microbiota might directly influence C. albicans physiology via production of WOAs, with possible implications of how this fungus interacts with its hosts in both health and disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49310	The transcriptional stress response of Candida albicans to weak organic acids.

We now report that ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE. ZNF658 was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of a band excised after EMSA using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers. It has similarity with ZAP1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to be functional also in ZNF658. siRNA targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5), SLC30A10 (ZnT10) and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered large changes in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59385	The zinc finger protein ZNF658 regulates the transcription of genes involved in zinc homeostasis and affects ribosome biogenesis through the zinc transcriptional regulatory element.

RPL26 UFMylation and deUFMylation is catalyzed by enzyme complexes tethered to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER and UFMylated RPL26 is highly enriched on ER membrane-bound ribosomes and polysomes. Biochemical analysis and structural modeling establish that UFMylated RPL26 and the UFMylation machinery are in close proximity to the SEC61 translocon, suggesting that this modification plays a direct role in cotranslational protein translocation into the ER.

The regulatory processes that shape the platelet transcriptome and the full scope of platelet translation have remained elusive. Using RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling of primary human platelets, we show the platelet transcriptome encompasses a subset of transcripts detected by RNA-Seq analysis of in vitro derived MK cells and these platelet-enriched transcripts are broadly occupied by ribosomes. We use RNA sequencing of synchronized populations of in vitro derived platelet-like particles (PLPs) to show that mRNA decay strongly shapes the nascent platelet transcriptome.

However, mTOR-sensitive translatomes commonly include mRNAs with a 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, but not ISGs. Because these translatomes were obtained under conditions when ISG expression is not induced, we examined the mTOR-sensitive translatome in human WISH cells stimulated with IFNβ. The mTOR inhibitor Torin1 resulted in a repression of global protein synthesis, including that of ISG products, and translation of all but 3 ISG mRNAs (TLR3, NT5C3A, and RNF19B) was not selectively more sensitive to mTOR inhibition. Detailed studies of NT5C3A revealed an IFN-induced change in transcription start site resulting in a switch from a non-TOP to a TOP-like transcript variant and mTOR sensitive translation. Thus, we show that, in the cell model used, translation of the vast majority of ISG mRNAs is not selectively sensitive to mTOR activity and describe an uncharacterized mechanism wherein the 5’-UTR of an mRNA is altered in response to a cytokine, resulting in a shift from mTOR-insensitive to mTOR-sensitive translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70270	Assessment of mTOR-Dependent Translational Regulation of Interferon Stimulated Genes.

GSE14335	Homo sapiens	10	Expression profiling by array	GPL571	Whole genome profiling of fibroblasts from Diamond-Blackfan Anemia patients	2009-01-08	Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited red cell hypoplasia characterized by a defect in the maturation of erythroid progenitors and is in some cases associated to malformations. Patients have an increased risk of solid tumors. Mutations have been found in several ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Studies in hematopoietic progenitors from patients show that the haploinsufficiency of an RP impairs rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. DBA lymphocytes and fibroblasts show reduced protein synthesis, and the latter display abnormal rRNA processing and impaired proliferation. To evaluate the involvement of non-hematopoietic tissues in DBA, we have analyzed global gene expression in fibroblasts from DBA patients compared to healthy controls. Microarray expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays revealed that 421 genes are statistically significantly differentially expressed in DBA patients' fibroblasts relative to controls. These genes include a large cluster of ribosomal proteins and factors involved in protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes with roles in cell death, cancer and tissue development. Our results report for the first time into abnormal expression in a non-hematopoietic cell type in DBA, and support the hypothesis that DBA may be due to a defect in general or specific protein synthesis.

GSE68435	Schizosaccharomyces pombe	12	Expression profiling by array	GPL2529	Yeast m6A methylated mRNAs are enriched on translating ribosomes during meiosis, and under Rapamycin treatment	2015-04-30	Interest in mRNA methylation has exploded in recent years. The sudden interest in a 40 year old discovery was due in part to the recent finding of FTO?s (Fat Mass Obesity) N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) deaminase activity, thus suggested a link between obesity-associated diseases and the presence of m6A in mRNA. Another catalyst of the sudden rise in mRNA methylation research was the release of mRNA methylomes for human, mouse and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the molecular function, or functions of this mRNA ?epimark? remain to be discovered. There is supportive evidence that m6A could be a mark for mRNA degradation due to its binding to YTH domain proteins, and consequently being chaperoned to P bodies. Nonetheless, only a subpopulation of the methylome was found binding to YTHDF2 in HeLa cells. The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has only one YTH domain protein (Pho92, Mrb1), which targets PHO4 transcripts for degradation under phosphate starvation. However, mRNA methylation is only found under meiosis inducing conditions, and PHO4 transcripts are apparently non-methylated. In this paper we set out to investigate if m6A could function alternatively to being a degradation mark in S. cerevisiae, we also sought to test whether it can be induced under non-standard sporulation conditions. We find associations between the presence of m6A and message translatability. We also find m6A induction following prolonged rapamycin treatment.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68435	Yeast m6A Methylated mRNAs Are Enriched on Translating Ribosomes during Meiosis, and under Rapamycin Treatment.

Platforms using the whole adult organism to evaluate the genome-wide response to toxicants are especially attractive. Recent work demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in vertebrates using the experimentally robust zebrafish model. In the present study, we evaluated gene expression changes in whole adult zebrafish following an acute 24 hour exposure to three metals with known human health risks. Male adult zebrafish were exposed to nickel chloride, cobalt chloride, and sodium dichromate concentrations corresponding to their respective 96 hr LC20, LC40 and LC60. Histopathology was performed on a subset of metal-exposed zebrafish to phenotypically anchor transcriptional changes associated with each metal. Comparative analysis identified subsets of differentially expressed transcripts both overlapping and unique to each metal. Application of gene ontology (GO) and transcription factor enrichment algorithms revealed a number of key biological processes perturbed by metal exposures and the master transcriptional regulators mediating gene expression changes. Metal exposures differentially activated biological processes associated with ribosome biogenesis, proteosomal degradation and p53 signaling cascades, while repressing oxygen-generating pathways associated with amino acid and lipid metabolism. Despite appreciable effects on gene regulation, nickel exposures did not induce any morphological alterations in zebrafish organs and tissues. Histopathological effects of cobalt remained confined to the olfactory system, while chromium targeted the gills, pharynx and intestinal mucosa. A number of enriched transcription factors mediate the observed gene response to metal exposure, including known targets such as p53, HIF1 and the myc oncogene and novel regulatory factors such as XBP1, GATA6 and HNF3. This work uses an experimentally innovative approach to capture global responses to metal exposures and provides mechanistic insights into metal toxicity mechanisms.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50648	Whole adult organism transcriptional profiling of acute metal exposures in male zebrafish.

Immediately after depolarisation, genes with known function at the synapse were subjected to a surge of translational activity without corresponding changes in mRNA levels. At later time-points, however, these changes became synchronised, suggesting there are different layers of post-transcriptional regulation which are temporally separated but become coordinated over time. Sequencing of small RNAs additionally revealed that changes in microRNA (miRNA) and tRNA-derived small RNA fragments (tRFs) coincided with this early post-transcriptional disparity, however these molecules exhibited strongest association with the remodelling of mRNA steady-state levels. Transcripts displaying high levels of translational dynamics relative to underlying mRNA levels were characterised by more intrinsic features, including mRNA length, GC content, secondary structure and motifs for RNA binding proteins. These data suggest that activity-associated neuronal translation is initially regulated independently of mRNA levels, wherein transcript features contribute to modulation of mRNA translatability, while miRNA and tRFs fine-tune mRNA levels.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE155727	Transcriptome-Wide Analysis of Interplay between mRNA Stability, Translation and Small RNAs in Response to Neuronal Membrane Depolarization.

There are several variants of the ribosome profiling technique that use different translation inhibitors. The regular ribo-seq utilizes Cycloheximide (CHX), a translation elongation inhibitor to freeze all translating ribosomes. In contrast to CHX, the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM) and harringtonine (Harr) have a much stronger effect on initiating ribosomes. The use of these inhibitors allows for the global mapping of translating initiating sites (TISs) when they are coupled with ribosome profiling (TI-seq). We have developed a computational tool to detect and/or quantitatively compare translation initiation from TI-seq data, and predict novel ORFs from regular CHX-based ribo-seq data. Two replicates of CHX-based ribo-seq experiments and one Harr based ribo-seq were performed in HEK293 cells for confirming the ORFs predicted using public available data.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94460	Genome-wide identification and differential analysis of translational initiation.

While the highly abundant N6-methyladonsine (m6A) modification affects most aspects of mRNA function, the precise functions of the rarer 5-methylcytosine (m5C) remains largely unknown. Here, we map m5C in the human transcriptome using methylation-dependent individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) combined with RNA bisulfite sequencing. We identify NSUN6 as a methyltransferase with strong substrate specificity towards mRNA. NSUN6 primarily targeted three prime untranslated regions (3’UTR) at the consensus sequence motif CTCCA. Knockout and rescue experiments revealed that only mRNA methylation sites containing the consensus motif depended on the presence of NSUN6. Furthermore, ribosome profiling demonstrated that NSUN6-specific consensus motifs marked translation termination. However, even though NSUN6-methylated mRNAs were reduced in NSUN6 knockout cells, NSUN6 was dispensable for mouse embryonic development. Thus, our study identifies NSUN6 as methyltransferase targeting mRNA in a sequence- and structure-specific manner.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140997	Sequence- and structure-specific cytosine-5 mRNA methylation by NSUN6.

GSE76766	Homo sapiens	24	Expression profiling by array	GPL18190	mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate ternary and eIF4F complex assembly	2016-01-12	mRNA translation plays a major role in homeostasis, whereas its dysregulation underpins a variety of pathological states including cancer, metabolic syndrome and neurological disorders. Ternary complex (TC) and eIF4F complex assembly are two major rate-limiting steps in translation initiation that are thought to be regulated by eIF2α phosphorylation, and the mTOR/4E-BP pathway, respectively2. However, how TC and eIF4F assembly are coordinated remains largely unknown. Using polysome-profiling, we show that on a genome-wide scale mTOR suppresses translation of mRNAs, which are translationally activated under short-term ER stress when TC recycling is attenuated by eIF2α phosphorylation. During acute nutrient or growth factor stimulation, mTORC1 induces eIF2β phosphorylation, which increases recruitment of NCK1 to eIF2, decreases eIF2α phosphorylation and bolsters TC recycling. Accordingly, eIF2β appears to act as a previously unidentified mediator of mTORC1 on protein synthesis and proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate a formerly undocumented role for CK2 in regulation of translation initiation, whereby CK2 stimulates phosphorylation of eIF2β and simultaneously bolsters eIF4F complex assembly via the mTORC1/4E-BP pathway. These findings imply a previously unrecognized mode of translation regulation whereby mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate TC and eIF4F complex assembly to stimulate cell proliferation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76766	mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate ternary and eIF4F complex assembly.

Although variation in RNA levels, transcription factor binding and chromatin have been explored, little is known about global variation in translation and its genetic determinants among humans. We used ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a diverse group of individuals. We find significant differences in RNA levels, translation, and protein abundance suggesting diverse mechanisms of personalized gene expression control. Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences. Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy - many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs.

We further show that RACK1 is an essential determinant for hepatitis C virus translation and infection indicating that its function is conserved among distantly related human and fly viruses. Inhibition of RACK1 does not affect Drosophila or human cell viability and proliferation, and RACK1-silenced adult flies are viable, indicating that this protein is not essential for general translation.

A very robust technique is required to capture subtle but biologically significant differences in neurological disorders. Ribosome profiling, which is based on deep sequencing of mRNA fragments protected from ribonuclease digestion by ribosomes, is a powerful tool to study translational control. However, it has been mainly applied to rapidly dividing cells where translation is robust and where large amounts of starting material are readily available. The application of ribosome profiling to low-input brain tissue where translation is modest and where gene expression changes between genotypes are expected to be small has not been carefully evaluated. Using hippocampal tissue from wide type and fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout mice, we show that variable RNase digestion can lead to significant sample batch effects. We also establish GC content and ribosome footprint length as quality control metrics for ribonuclease digestion. We performed ribonuclease titration experiments for low-input samples to identify optimal conditions for this critical step that is often improperly conducted. Our data reveal that optimal RNase digestion is essential to ensure high quality and reproducibility of ribosome profiling especially for low-input brain tissue.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116233	Optimization of ribosome profiling using low-input brain tissue from fragile X syndrome model mice.

This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eIF2. However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a ~4.5-fold general translational repression, the protein coding ORFs of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated uORF that repress translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases.

Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3’ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The internal mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a post-decoding mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like “sticky” codons in the reporter message leads to increased +1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes codon “stickiness”. Further supporting the role of “sticky” sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes by minimizing the appearance of AUG-like codons in the frame 2. These results suggest an important layer of information embedded within the protein coding sequences that instructs the ribosome to ensure reading frame fidelity during translation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80156	A Coding Sequence-Embedded Principle Governs Translational Reading Frame Fidelity.

Although mammals have two eIF4A paralogs, eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, their redundancy has been long assumed because of high homology and their functional difference has been poorly understood. Here we show that eIF4A paralogs employ differential translation programs. Ribosome profiling of eIF4A1- and eIF4A2-knockout HEK293T cell lines revealed that translation efficiency changes were divergent across transcriptome and distinct group of mRNAs were regulated by each paralog.

By allowing for reprogrammed translation, these mechanisms can mediate biological responses to stress stimuli. We combined proteomics with ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing to identify the biological targets of translation control triggered by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1), a protein implicated in the stringency of start codon selection. We quantified expression changes of over 4,000 proteins and 10,000 actively translated transcripts, leading to the identification of 245 transcripts undergoing translational control mediated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) upon eIF1 deprivation. The stringency of start codon selection and preference for optimal nucleotide context were largely diminished leading to translational regulation of uORFs with sub-optimal start sites. Affected genes were implicated in energy production and sensing of metabolic stress. Interestingly, knockdown of eIF1 elicited a synergic response from eIF5 and eIF1B.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87328	eIF1 modulates the recognition of suboptimal translation initiation sites and steers gene expression via uORFs.

In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5' UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause-relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhanced upstream translation within 5' UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript where this resulted in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced usage of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons. Thus, we propose that eIF5A functions not only to maintain efficient translation elongation in eukaryotic cells, but also to maintain the fidelity of translation initiation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132008	Suppression of Ribosomal Pausing by eIF5A Is Necessary to Maintain the Fidelity of Start Codon Selection.

Using quantitative mass spectrometry we identified Late-annotated short open reading frame 2 (Lso2) as a ribosome-associated protein that is broadly conserved in eukaryotes. Genome-wide crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of Lso2 and its human ortholog CCDC124 recovered 25S rRNA in a region near the A site that overlaps the GTPase activating center. Consistent with this location, Lso2 also crosslinked to most tRNAs. Ribosome profiling of yeast lacking LSO2 (lso2Δ) revealed global translation defects during recovery from stationary phase with translation of most genes reduced more than 4-fold. Ribosomes accumulated at start codons, were depleted from stop codons, and showed codon-specific changes in occupancy in lso2Δ. These defects, and the conservation of the specific ribosome-binding activity of Lso2/CCDC124, indicate broadly important functions in translation and physiology.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109343	Lso2 is a conserved ribosome-bound protein required for translational recovery in yeast.

This has been most intensively studied in the case of histone proteins, where lysine methylations in the flexible tails are determinants of chromatin state and gene expression. Lysine methylations on non-histone proteins are also frequent, but in most cases the functional significance of the methylation event, as well as the identity of the responsible lysine (K) specific methyltransferase (KMT), remain unknown. While the majority of identified human KMTs belong to the SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax)-domain class of methyltransferases (MTases), several recently discovered KMTs belong to a different MTase class, the seven-beta-strand (7BS) MTases. Here, we have investigated an uncharacterized human 7BS MTase currently annotated as being part of the endothelin converting enzyme 2 (ECE2). However, transcriptomics data indicate that this MTase is not part of ECE2, and should be considered a separate protein. Combining in vitro enzymology and analyses of knockout cells, we demonstrate that this MTase efficiently methylates K36 in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that this novel KMT is named eEF1A-KMT4 (gene name EEF1AKMT4), in agreement with the recently established nomenclature. Furthermore, by ribosome profiling we show that the absence of K36 methylation affects translation dynamics and changes translation speed of distinct codons. Finally, we demonstrate that eEF1A-KMT4 is part of a novel family of human KMTs, defined by a shared sequence motif in the active site, and we show the importance of this motif for catalytic activity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97140	Methylation of human eukaryotic elongation factor alpha (eEF1A) by a member of a novel protein lysine methyltransferase family modulates mRNA translation.

When activated, it endonucleolytically cleaves both viral and host RNAs, leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis. However, it remains unknown how widespread RNA decay, and consequent changes in the translatome, promote the elimination of viruses. To study how this altered transcriptome is translated, we assayed the global distribution of ribosomes in RNase L activated human cells with ribosome profiling. We found that RNase L activation leads to a substantial increase in the fraction of translating ribosomes in ORFs internal to coding sequences (iORFs) and ORFs within 5’ and 3’ UTRs (uORFs and dORFs). Translation of these alternative ORFs was dependent on RNase L’s cleavage activity, suggesting that mRNA decay fragments are translated to produce short peptides that may be important for antiviral activity.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158044	Activation of the antiviral factor RNase L triggers translation of non-coding mRNA sequences.

We found that IFN-g regulates macrophage metabolism and translation in an integrated manner by targeting mTORC1 and MNK pathways that converge on the selective regulator of translation initiation eIF4E. Physiological downregulation of the central metabolic regulator mTORC1 by IFN-g was associated with autophagy and translational suppression of repressors of inflammation such as HES1. Genome-wide ribosome profiling in TLR2-stimulated macrophages revealed that IFN-g selectively modulates the macrophage translatome to promote inflammation, further reprogram metabolic pathways, and modulate protein synthesis. These results add IFN-g-mediated metabolic reprogramming and translational regulation as key components of classical inflammatory macrophage activation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66808	Interferon-γ regulates cellular metabolism and mRNA translation to potentiate macrophage activation.

GSE78807	Oikopleura dioica	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL21546	Genome-wide profiling of mTOR-dependent translation in Oikopleura dioica	2016-03-01	Protein synthesis is an energy-demanding process essential for cell proliferation and survival. Balancing the cost of protein synthesis with available resources has driven the evolution of its nutrient-dependent regulation. A central mechanism in this regulation is the repression of translation of the protein synthesis machinery during unfavorable growth conditions. This is mediated via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of growth conserved from yeast to human. Despite extensive research, and the elucidation of a number of important factors, how mRNAs are translationally regulated by mTOR is still unclear. Repression depends on a 5’ Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine (TOP) motif which is conserved across vertebrates and present in Drosophila melanogaster. In Caenorhabditis elegans and the marine chordate Oikopleura dioica most TOP mRNAs are trans-spliced to a spliced leader. This results in the removal of the originally transcribed 5’ end and its replacement with a common short RNA sequence. In both species the 5’ end of the spliced leader is pyrimidine-enriched but does not meet strict requirements for a canonical TOP motif. How this affects the translational control of TOP mRNAs is unknown. Here, using transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling on whole animals treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, we show that trans-spliced TOP mRNAs in O. dioica are subject to mTOR-dependent translational control. We also show, using existing data, that trans-spliced transcripts in C. elegans are differentially translated upon recovery from starvation-induced developmental diapause. Together our results demonstrate that spliced leaders in metazoans are targets for mTOR-dependent translational control in response to nutrient availability. This indicates that trans-splicing in metazoans, the function of which has remained largely enigmatic, plays a key role in the coordinated translational regulation of growth-related genes. Moreover, our results reveal an innovative strategy for rapid evolution and developmental control of downstream targets of the ancient mTOR pathway.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78807	Trans-splicing of mRNAs links gene transcription to translational control regulated by mTOR.

The molecular fingerprint for this rare, severe and unique clinical entity is still not elucidated. The goal of the present work was to detect both gene expression levels and alternate RNA splice variants specific to IBC. Experimental Design: In order to identify differentially expressed genes and splicing events, we performed splice-sensitive array profiling using Affymetrix Exon Array and quantitative RT-PCR analyses in a large series of 177 IBC compared to 183 non-IBC. We also assessed the prognostic value of the identified candidate genes and splice variants. Results: A 5-splice signature (HSPA8, RPL10, RPL4, DIDO1 and EVL) was able to distinguish IBC from non-IBC tumors (p<10-7). This splice signature was associated with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) in hormone receptor-negative non-IBC (p=0.02), whereas it had no prognostic value in IBC patients. A PAM analysis of deregulated genes in IBC compared to non-IBC identified a 10-gene signature highly predictive of IBC phenotype and conferring a poor prognosis in non-IBC. The most up-regulated genes in IBC were 3 hemoglobin genes able to highly discriminate IBC from non IBC (p<10-4). In epithelial breast tumor cells, Hb protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: IBC has a specific spliced transcript profile that deserves further functional studies. Above all, IBC is characterized by hemoglobin genes overexpression, a fact that may lead to increased tumor progression. If confirmed, hemoglobins may serve as therapeutic targets.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111477	Hemoglobin overexpression and splice signature as new features of inflammatory breast cancer?

This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric, which potentially adds an additional layer of variety and dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The m6A-modified mRNA can be selectively recognized by the YTH family “reader” proteins. The preferential binding of m6A-containing mRNA by YTHDF2 is known to reduce the stability of the target transcripts; however, the exact effects of m6A on translation has yet to be elucidated. Here we show that another m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, promotes ribosome loading of its target transcripts. YTHDF1 forms a complex with translation initiation factors to elevate the translation efficiency of its bound mRNA. In a unified mechanism of translation control through m6A, the YTHDF2-mediated decay controls the lifetime of target transcripts; whereas, the YTHDF1-based translation promotion increases the translation efficiency to ensure effective protein production from relatively short-lived transcripts that are marked by m6A.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63591	N(6)-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency.

The eIF4A/DDX2 RNA helicase drives translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5’UTRs. The natural compound silvestrol and synthetic analogues are potent and selective inhibitors of eIF4A1/2 that show promising activity in models of hematological malignancies.

Moreover, we see single agent activity in the KRAS/p53 mouse PDAC model and also against PDAC xenografts and primary, patient derived PDAC tumors. These therapeutic effects occur at non-toxic dose levels. Transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling, analyses of protein and gene expression, and translation reporter studies reveal that eIF4A inhibitors block an oncogenic translation program in PDAC cells that includes G-quadruplex containing mRNAs such as KRAS, MYC, YAP1, MET, SMAD3, TGFβ and others. Together, our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A disrupts oncoprotein production and shows efficacy across several PDAC models.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120159	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA491747	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA491747	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP162072

This approach yields unprecedented depth in the coverage of individual low-abundance transcripts allowing identification of slow and fast translating regions with nucleotide resolution.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104587	None	None	None	None	None	'total RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA413138	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA413138	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP119397
GSE110868	Mus musculus	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	GPL13112	Identification and validation of GPD1 as an essential cancer stem cell specific target in glioblastoma (RNA-seq: Gpd1 KO)	2018-02-20	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are attractive targets for cancer therapy, however, little is known about how to target CSCs without affecting the normal stem cell population. Here we report the ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells and brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs), which leads to the identification of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) as a CSC- specific determinant. We confirmed that GPD1 is expressed in BTSCs but not in neural stem cells. Intriguingly, expression of GPD1 is only found in the infiltrating dormant BTSCs in vivo and these cells start to divide and drive tumour relapse after chemotherapy. Most importantly, inhibition of GPD1 expression in tumour-bearing mice leads to prolonged survival. Further analysis shows that loss of GPD1 results in widespread changes in important pathways affecting BTSC maintenance. Human patient data analysis suggests that GPD1 is expressed in the dormant infiltrating tumour cells in human glioblastoma and the expression level is associated with a worse prognosis. This study provides an attractive therapeutic target for treating brain tumours and a novel aspect of regulation of CSC dormancy.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110868	None	None	None	None	None	'polyA RNA'	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA434718	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA434718	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP133177

GSE118035	Homo sapiens	18	Expression profiling by array	GPL10558	Protein Syndesmos is a novel RNA binding protein that regulates primary cilia formation [Illumina array]	2018-08-02	We show here that SDOS interacts with another important cancer-linked protein, the chaperone TRAP1, associates with actively translating polyribosomes and represses translation. Moreover, we demonstrate that SDOS binds directly RNA in living cells. Combining individual gene expression profiling, nucleotide cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), and ribosome profiling, we discover several crucial pathways regulated post-transcriptionally by SDOS.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118035	Protein Syndesmos is a novel RNA-binding protein that regulates primary cilia formation.
