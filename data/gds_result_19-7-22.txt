(Submitter supplied) Iron dyshomeostasis contributes to aging, but little information is available about the molecular mechanisms. Here, we provide evidence that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aging is associated with altered expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. We further demonstrate that defects in the conserved mRNA-binding protein Cth2, which controls stability and translation of mRNAs encoding iron-containing proteins, increase lifespan by alleviating its repressive effects on mitochondrial function. more...

Here, we investigated the post-transcriptional influence of TOP3B and associated proteins on mRNA translation and turnover.  First, we discovered that in human HCT116 colon cancer cells, knock-out (KO) of TOP3B had similar effects on mRNA turnover and translation as did TDRD3-KO, while FMRP-KO resulted in rather distinct effects, indicating that TOP3B had stronger coordination with TDRD3 than FMRP in mRNA regulation. more...

19. Ribosome impairment regulates intestinal stem cell identity via ZAKɑ activation
(Submitter supplied) We show that ribosome collisions, induced by Rptor deletion or aminoacid starvation, causes a ZAK alpha mediated identity switch in intestinal stem cells by activating a more fetal-like stem cell signature. This switch also causes changes in metabolic profiles of the cells, which is heavily regulated by RNA translation efficiency of different group of metabolic genes. These observations originate from performing in vitro Riboseq and RNAseq in mouse intestinal organoids, and in vivo Riboseq in Lgr5 expressing intestinal stem cells from WT and Rptor.fl/fl mice.

While cytidine acetylation (ac4C) within protein-coding sequences stimulates translation, ac4C within 5’UTRs impacts protein synthesis at the level of initiation. 5’UTR acetylation promotes initiation at upstream sequences, competitively inhibiting annotated start codons. more...

37. eIF4A2 targets developmental potency and histone H3.3 transcripts for translational control of embryonic and cancer stemness [Ribo-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Stemness is a defining feature in embryonic and cancer stem cells. How stemness is regulated at the mRNA translational initiation remains undefined. We carried out an RNAi screen for key translation initiation factors that maintain the stemness in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We identified eIF4A2 and defined its mechanistic action through Rps26-depleted and -containing ribosomes in translational initiation activation of mRNAs encoding pluripotency factors and H3.3 for embryonic and extraembryonic lineage repression, respectively. more...

38. Ultrasensitive Ribo-seq reveals translational landscapes during mammalian oocyte-to-embryo transition and pre-implantation development
(Submitter supplied) In mammals, translational control plays critical roles during oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) when transcription ceases. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain challenging to study. Using low-input Ribo-seq (Ribo-lite), we investigated translational landscapes during OET using 30-150 mouse oocytes and embryos per stage. Ribo-lite can also accommodate single oocytes. Combining PAIso-seq to interrogate poly(A) tail lengths, we found a global switch of translatome that closely parallels changes of poly(A) tails upon meiotic resumption. more...

(Submitter supplied) Antibiotics of the orthosomycin class bind at a distinct site on the large subunit of the bacterial ribosome not used by any other known protein synthesis inhibitor. Structural and biochemical in vitro studies suggested that orthosomycins should block accommodation of aminoacyl-tRNAs in the ribosomal A-site arresting the ribosome at the start codons of the genes. However, the mode of action of orthosomycins in the living cell remains unknown. more...

40. Ribo-Seq experiments in HCT116 WT and TP53-/- cells upon neocarzinostatin treatment
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor p53 exerts its tumor suppressive effects through transcriptional activation of numerous target genes controlling cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cellular senescence and DNA repair. In addition, there is evidence that p53 influences the translation of specific mRNAs, including translational attenuation of ribosomal protein synthesis and translational activation of MDM2. A challenge in the analysis of translational control is that changes in mRNA abundance exert a kinetic (passive) effect on ribosome densities. more...

(Submitter supplied) Kasugamycin (KSG) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used in agriculture and exhibiting considerable medical potential. Previous studies suggested that KSG interferes with translation by blocking binding of canonical mRNA and initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit thereby preventing initiation of protein synthesis. Here, by using genome-wide approaches, we show that KSG can interfere with translation even after the formation of the 70S initiation complex on mRNA, as the extent of KSG-mediated translation inhibition correlates with increased occupancy of start codons by 70S ribosomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is typically caused by mutations that disrupt the DMD reading frame, but nonsense mutations in the 5’ part of the gene lead to the utilization of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in exon 5, resulting in expression of a highly functional N-truncated dystrophin. We have developed an AAV9 vector expressing U7 small nuclear RNAs targeting DMD exon 2 and tested it in a mouse model containing a duplication of exon 2, in which skipping of both exon 2 copies results in IRES-induced expression, and skipping of only one exon 2 leads to wild-type dystrophin expression. more...

72. Peroxisome function relies on organelle-associated mRNA translation
(Submitter supplied) Crucial metabolic functions of peroxisomes rely on a variety of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). While mRNA transcripts of PMPs were shown to be colocalized with peroxisomes, the process by which PMPs efficiently couple translation with targeting to the peroxisomal membrane remained elusive. Here, we combine quantitative electron microscopy with proximity-specific ribosome profiling and reveal that translation of specific PMPs occurs on the surface of peroxisomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. more...

(Submitter supplied) The fidelity of start codon recognition by ribosomes is paramount during protein synthesis. The textbook knowledge of eukaryotic translation initiation depicts 5’→3’ unidirectional migration of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) along the 5’UTR. In probing translation initiation from ultra-short 5’UTR, we report that an AUG triplet near the 5’ end can be selected via PIC backsliding. The bi-directional ribosome scanning is supported by competitive selection of closely spaced AUG codons and recognition of two initiation sites flanking an internal ribosome entry site. more...

DDX3X is frequently mutated in Burkitt lymphoma but the functional basis for this is unknown. Here, we show that loss-of-function DDX3X mutations are also commonly found in MYC-translocated diffuse large B cell lymphoma and reveal functional co-operation between mutant DDX3X and MYC. We show that DDX3X promotes translation of mRNAs encoding components of the core translational machinery, thereby driving global protein synthesis. more...

(Submitter supplied) N1-methylation of G37 is required for a subset of tRNAs to maintain the translational reading-frame. While loss of m1G37 increases ribosomal +1 frameshifting, whether it incurs additional translational defects is unknown. Here we address this question by applying ribosome profiling to gain a genome-wide view of the effects of m1G37 deficiency on protein synthesis. Using E. coli as a model, we show that m1G37 deficiency induces ribosome stalling at codons that are normally translated by m1G37-containing tRNAs. more...

118. Regulation of translation by site-specific ribosomal RNA methylation [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) We report that 2’-O-methylation levels at subset of positions in human ribosomal RNA are variable between cell types and conditions, and that the degree of methylation at distinct sites is responsive to key cellular pathways. MYC overexpression results in increased methylation at a particular rRNA site (18S:C174). We find that this methylation is important for modulating translation of distinct mRNAs, leading to phenotypic changes including modulation of cell proliferation rate.

Interestingly, the ribo-seq data has shown that a large number of mRNAs were significantly downregulated in the peptide-knockdown samples. Finally, we discovered that high expression of the peptide supported a specific translation program to facilitate cancer progression.

The eIF2α phosphorylation blocks the ternary complex formation and therefore inhibits translation initiation. Meanwhile, GCN2 activation associates with ribosomes and some translation elongation factors such as eEF1A. In Neurospora crassa, the homolog of GCN2 is CPC-3. more...

122. Innate, translation-dependent silencing of an invasive transposon in Arabidopsis
(Submitter supplied) Co-evolution between hosts' and parasites' genomes shapes diverse pathways of acquired immunity based on silencing small (s)RNAs. In plants, sRNAs cause heterochromatinization, sequence-degeneration and, ultimately, loss-of-autonomy of most transposable elements (TEs). Recognition of newly-invasive plant TEs, by contrast, involves an innate antiviral-like silencing response. To investigate this response's activation, we studied the single-copy element EVADÉ (EVD), one of few representatives of the large Ty1/Copia family able to proliferate in Arabidopsis when epigenetically-reactivated. more...

To measure ribosome density on nascent mRNA, we developed nascent Ribo-Seq (nRibo-Seq) by combining Ribo-Seq with progressive 4-thiouridine labelling. In mouse macrophages, we experimentally determined, for the first time, the lag between the appearance of nascent RNA and its association with ribosomes, which was calculated to be 20 - 22 min for bulk mRNA, and approximated the time it takes for mRNAs to be fully loaded with ribosomes to be 41 - 44 min. more...

139. A role for the ribosome-associated complex in activation of the IRE1 branch of UPR
(Submitter supplied) The ubiquitous ribosome-associated complex (RAC) is a chaperone that spans ribosomes, making contacts near both the polypeptide exit tunnel and the decoding center, a position prime for sensing and coordinating translation and folding. Loss of RAC is known to result in growth defects and sensitization to translational and osmotic stresses. However, the physiological substrates of RAC and the mechanism(s) by which RAC is involved in responding to specific stresses in higher eukaryotes remain obscure. more...

Recent evidence has highlighted the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of mRNA expression, stability and translation, supporting a potential role for post-transcriptional regulation mediated by m6A in cancer. Here we explore prostate cancer as an exemplar cancer and generate the first prostate m6A maps, and further examined how low levels of N6-adenosine-methyltransferase (METTL3) associates with advanced prostate cancer and results in altered expression at the level of transcription, translation, and protein. more...

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease recurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that 18S rRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A1832) modification and its methyltransferase complex METTL5/TRMT112 were upregulated in HCC and correlated with poor prognosis. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays demonstrated that METTL5/TRMT112 mediated 18S rRNA m6A1832 modification promotes HCC tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. more...

Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the mammalian ribosome in the process of translating viral RNA paused in a conformation primed for frameshifting. We observe that the viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure lodged at the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome to generate tension in the mRNA that leads to frameshifting. more...

(Submitter supplied) The C.elegans translatomes of single-nt let-7a 3' non-seed mutants (U13A / U18A). In order to identified gene perturbance caused by disrupting 3' non-seed pairing of let-7a, we examined the global gene expression at tranlational levels of L4 whole animals by ribosome profiling. We found that let-7a U13A mutation results in overexpression135/351 Note for let-7a U13A mutation, lin-41(ma480) was used in the background to filter out downstream regulation related to the lin-41 pathway.

(Submitter supplied) Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is activated as part of the innate immune response and plays an important role in the clearance of viral infections. When activated, it endonucleolytically cleaves both viral and host RNAs, leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis. However, it remains unknown how widespread RNA decay, and consequent changes in the translatome, promote the elimination of viruses. To study how this altered transcriptome is translated, we assayed the global distribution of ribosomes in RNase L activated human cells with ribosome profiling. more...

198. Ribosome profiling on heat shocked wild type and Mettl14 -/- mES cells
(Submitter supplied) Abstract : "A hallmark of the cellular response to environmental stress is the formation of stress granules.  Stress granules are RNA-protein assemblies that provide an adaptive response to stress; however, the basis for their formation and how they contribute to the stress response remains incompletely understood.  Here we show that the mRNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a mark that targets mRNAs to stress granules. more...

199. Germline inherited small RNAs facilitate the clearance of untranslated maternal mRNAs in C. elegans embryos (Ribo-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Inheritance and clearance of maternal mRNAs are two of the most critical events required for animal early embryonic development. However, the mechanisms regulating this process are still largely unknown. Here, we show that together with maternal mRNAs, C. elegans embryos inherit a complementary pool of small non-coding RNAs that facilitate the cleavage and removal of hundreds of maternal mRNAs. These antisense small RNAs are loaded into the maternal catalytically-active Argonaute CSR-1 and cleave complementary mRNAs no longer engaged in translation in somatic blastomeres. more...

(Submitter supplied) We use RNA-seq and Ribo-seq to analyze expression changes in the Long Term Evolution Experiment. By comparing expression levels between the ancestral strains and each of the evolved lines, we find that expression changes are largely parallel after 22 years of evolution, that these changes occur in specific pathways, and that known mutations may be responsible for some of the observed expression changes.

202. Combined analysis of ribo-seq and rna-seq reveals that Mettl3 regulates embryonic cerebral cortex development in mice by controlling the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most important internal messenger RNA (mRNA) modification in mammals. The role of Mettl3, the core component of methyltransferase, and Fto, the demethylase, has not been revealed in the embryonic development of the cerebral cortex in mice. We constructed the conditional knockout of Mettl3 and Fto in the cerebral cortex of mice. We found that Mettl3 deletion causes cell cycle extension of progenitors and massive proliferation of intermediate progenitors at E15.5, which lead to a fold structure of cortex, while Fto deletion hardly altered cell numbers or morphology. more...

However, stop codon readthrough can occur when a near-cognate tRNA outcompetes eRF1 in decoding the stop codon, resulting in the continuation of the elongation phase of protein synthesis. At the end of a conventional mRNA coding region readthrough allows translation into the mRNA 3’-UTR. more...

While eEF3 has been implicated in tRNA binding and release at the A and E sites, its exact mechanism of action is unclear. Here we show that eEF3 acts at the mRNA–tRNA translocation step by promoting the dissociation of the tRNA from the E site, but independent of aminoacyl-tRNA recruitment to the A site. more...

230. 4EHP and GIGYF1/2 induce translation-coupled messenger RNA decay
(Submitter supplied) Although canonical mRNA degradation is generally recognized to be translation dependent, our understanding of the molecular events that coordinate ribosome movement with the decay machinery is still limited. Here, we show that the 4EHP–GIGYF1/2 complex triggers co-translational mRNA decay as a result of altered ribosome activity during elongation. Human cells lacking 4EHP and GIGYF1 and 2 proteins accumulate transcripts known to be degraded in a translation dependent manner or with prominent ribosome pausing. more...

(Submitter supplied) Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G2 is a long-known homologue of the canonical eIF4G1. However, unlike the latter, it does not bind eIF4E or PABP, thus it remains unclear what and when brings eIF4G2 onto a ribosome. Here we report results of  ribosome profiling performed in NIH 3T3 eIF4G2 (DAP5) -/- cells.

(Submitter supplied) Extensive tumor inflammation, reflected by high levels of infiltrating T-cells and Interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling, is thought to improve checkpoint immunotherapy response. However, many tumors escape by activating multiple cellular pathways that induce immunosuppression. One pivotal immune-suppressive mechanism is the production of Tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by IFNγ-induced IDO1 enzyme production. more...

233. RRF plays critical roles in ribosome homeostasis in E. coli but has little effect on translational coupling
(Submitter supplied) We used ribosome profiling to characterize the biological role of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) in Escherichia coli. As expected, RRF depletion leads to enrichment of post-termination 70S complexes in 3′-UTRs. We also observe that elongating ribosomes are unable to complete translation because they are blocked by non-recycled ribosomes at stop codons. Previous studies have suggested a role for recycling in translational coupling within operons; if a ribosome remains bound to an mRNA after termination, it may re-initiate downstream. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ribo-Seq (ribosome profiling) enables global assessment of translation efficiency, yields and fidelity. However, low-abundance transcripts receive little coverage and fall outside of the Ribo-Seq detection limit. We developed a new twist of the Ribo-Seq approach, termed transcript specific Ribo-Seq (tsRibo-Seq) to specifically detect lowly abundant messenger RNAs (mRNAs). This approach yields unprecedented depth in the coverage of individual low-abundance transcripts allowing identification of slow and fast translating regions with nucleotide resolution.

In vitro biochemical and structural studies showed that Api binds in the nascent peptide exit tunnel of a ribosome that has completed translation of a gene and traps the release factors on the ribosome. By analyzing the distribution of ribosomes on mRNAs in Api-treated cells using Ribo-seq, we uncovered a range of effects that stem from the unique mechanism of Api action. more...

However, the role of METTL1 and its cofactor WDR4 in cancer remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal the oncogenic role of METTL1/WDR4. METTL1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in cancers and correlates with poor patient survival. METTL1 depletion in human cancer cells causes decreased abundance of m7G-modified tRNAs, altered cell cycle, and inhibits oncogenicity. more...

267. Translation initiation site profiling reveals widespread synthesis of non-AUG-initiated protein isoforms in yeast
(Submitter supplied) Genomic analyses in budding yeast have helped to define the foundational principles of eukaryotic gene expression, but have systematically excluded specific classes of potential coding regions, including those with non-AUG start codons. Without methods to define coding regions empirically, the prevalence of these non-canonical coding regions has been impossible to assess. Here, we applied an experimental approach to globally annotate translation initiation sites in yeast and identified a class of 149 genes that encode N-terminally extended alternate protein isoforms that result from translation initiation at non-AUG codons upstream of the annotated AUG start codon. more...

271. Growth Optimized Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase Levels Prevent Maximal tRNA Charging
(Submitter supplied) Summary Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) serve a dual role in charging tRNAs. Their enzymatic activities both provide protein synthesis flux and reduce uncharged tRNA levels. Although uncharged tRNAs can negatively impact bacterial growth, substantial concentrations of tRNAs remain deacylated even under nutrient-rich conditions. Here we show that tRNA charging in Bacillus subtilis is not maximized due to optimization of aaRS production during rapid growth, which prioritizes demands in protein synthesis over charging levels. more...

Translation of the master stress response gene ATF4 increases in response to stress, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We discover here that translation initiation factors DENR, MCTS1 and eIF2D are absolutely required to induce ATF4 translation upon stress, by promoting translation reinitiation on the ATF4 5’UTR. more...

278. Control of Translation during the Unfolded Protein Response in Maize seedlings: Life without PERKs.
(Submitter supplied) The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) defines a condition called ER stress that induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR in mammalian cells attenuates protein synthesis initiation, which prevents the piling up of misfolded proteins in the ER. Mammalian cells rely on Protein Kinase RNA-Like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) phosphorylation of eIF2alpha to arrest protein synthesis, however, plants do not have a PERK homolog, so the question is whether plants control translation in response to ER stress. more...

We investigated the molecular impact of loss of n-Tr20 expression on the trancriptome and translatome in the forebrain and hippocampus of multiple n-Tr20 mutant and control strains. Loss of n-Tr20 altered translation initiation by activating the integrated stress response and suppressing mTOR signaling, the latter of which contributes to the enhanced GABAergic transmission.

294. Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of Fragile X mouse brain cortex
(Submitter supplied) Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by inactivation of FMR1 gene and loss of its encoded product the RNA binding protein FMRP, which generally represses translation of its target transcripts in the brain. In mouse models of FXS (i.e., Fmr1 knockout animals; Fmr1 KO), deletion of Cpeb1, which encodes a translational activator, mitigates nearly all pathophysiologies associated with the disorder. Here we reveal unexpected wide-spread dys-regulation of RNA abundance in Fmr1 KO brain cortex and its rescue to normal levels in Fmr1/Cpeb1 double KO mice. more...

Paradoxically, ribosome profiling studies in E. coli show no correlation between the strength of the SD in an mRNA and how efficiently it is translated. Performing profiling on ribosomes with altered anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences, we reveal a genome-wide correlation between SD strength and ribosome occupancy that was previously masked by other contributing factors. more...

(Submitter supplied) PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs essential for fertility. In adult mouse testes, most piRNAs are derived from long single-stranded RNAs lacking annotated open reading frames (ORFs). The mechanisms underlying how piRNA sequences are defined during the cleavages of piRNA precursors remain elusive. Here, we show that 80S ribosomes translate the 5′-proximal short ORFs (uORFs) of piRNA precursors. more...

To study SCR in vivo in a genome-wide manner, we treated mammalian cells with aminoglycosides and performed ribosome profiling. We find that in addition to stimulating readthrough of PTCs, aminoglycosides stimulate readthrough of normal termination codons (NTCs) genome-wide. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are unique molecular machines that translate 11 leaderless mRNAs. To date it is not clear how mitoribosomes recognize and initiate translation in the absence of untranslated regions in the mitochondrial mRNAs. Translation initiation in mitochondria shares similarities with prokaryotic systems, such as the formation of a ternary complex of fMet-tRNAMet, mRNA and the 28S subunit, but differs in the requirements for initiation factors. more...

(Submitter supplied) High-dose radiation is the main component of glioblastoma therapy. Unfortunately, radio-resistance is a common problem and a major contributor to tumor relapse. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving response to radiation is critical for identifying regulatory routes that could be targeted to improve treatment response. We conducted an integrated analysis in the U251 and U343 glioblastoma cell lines to map early alterations in the expression of genes at three levels: transcription, splicing, and translation in response to ionizing radiation.

Through unbiased proteomic analyses in erythroid cells, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein LIN28B, which is developmentally expressed in a reciprocal pattern to BCL11A, directly interacts with ribosomes. We show that the observed suppression of BCL11A protein translation is mediated by LIN28B through a direct interaction with BCL11A mRNA and independent of its role in let-7 microRNA biogenesis. more...

We profiled translation genome-wide using ribosome profiling in O. dioica during growth arrest and growth arrest recovery. We found that initial recovery is independent of nutrient-responsive, trans-spliced genes, suggesting that animal density is the primary trigger for the resumption of development in this species.

(Submitter supplied) Translation of an mRNA in eukaryotes starts at AUG in most cases. Near-cognate codons (NCCs) such as UUG, ACG and AUU are also used as start sites at low levels in S. cerevisiae. Initiation from NCCs or AUGs in the 5’-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs can lead to translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that might regulate expression of the main ORF (mORF). Although there is some circumstantial evidence that the translation of uORFs can be affected by environmental conditions, little is known about how it is affected by changes in growth temperature. more...

NMD is a RNA quality control mechanism, which detects and degrades aberrant mRNAs as well as some normal transcripts including those that harbor upstream open reading frames in their 5' leader sequence and long 3′ UTR. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the effect of either eRF3 or Upf1 depletion in human cells. more...

Although mammals have two eIF4A paralogs, eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, their redundancy has been long assumed because of high homology and their functional difference has been poorly understood. Here we show that eIF4A paralogs employ differential translation programs. Ribosome profiling of eIF4A1- and eIF4A2-knockout HEK293T cell lines revealed that translation efficiency changes were divergent across transcriptome and distinct group of mRNAs were regulated by each paralog. more...

387. eIF1 discriminates against suboptimal initiation sites to prevent excessive uORF translation genome-wide
(Submitter supplied) The translation pre-initiation complex (PIC) scans the mRNA for an AUG codon in favorable context. Previous findings suggest that the factor eIF1 discriminates against non-AUG start codons by impeding full accommodation of Met-tRNAi in the P site of the 40S ribosomal subunit, necessitating eIF1 dissociation for start codon selection. Consistent with this, yeast eIF1 substitutions that weaken its binding to the PIC increase initiation at UUG codons on a mutant his4 mRNA and particular synthetic mRNA reporters; and also at the AUG start codon of the mRNA for eIF1 itself owing to its poor Kozak context. more...

(Submitter supplied) Polyadenylation plays a key role in producing mature mRNAs in eukaryotes. It is widely believed that the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABs) uniformly bind to poly(A)-tailed mRNAs, regulating their stability and translational efficiency. Here, we characterized the RNA-binding landscape of three broadly expressed PABs in Arabidopsis thaliana. We observed substantial variation in the AtPAB-binding efficiency among mRNAs, which can be partly explained by the guanosine (G) content of poly(A) tails. more...

By integrating de novo transcriptome assembly and Ribo-Seq, we confidently annotate thousands of novel translated smORFs in three human cell lines. We find that smORF translation prediction is noisier than for annotated coding sequences, underscoring the importance of analyzing multiple experiments and footprinting conditions. more...

423. m6A in mRNA coding regions promotes translation via the RNA helicase-containing YTHDC2
(Submitter supplied) Dynamic mRNA modification in the form of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) adds considerable richness and sophistication to gene regulation. The m6A mark is asymmetrically distributed along mature mRNAs, with a strong preference around the stop codon and 3’UTR. Nevertheless, approximately 35% of m6A residues are located within the coding region (CDS). It has been suggested that methylation in CDS slows down translation elongation by interfering the decoding process. more...

Whether the operon organization maintains the stoichiometric expression of the genes within an operon remain under debate. In this study, we performed a label-free data-independent acquisition hyper reaction monitoring mass-spectrometry (HRM-MS) experiment to quantify the Escherichia coli proteome in exponential phase and quantified 93.6% of the cytosolic proteins, covering 67.9% and 56.0% of the translating polycistronic operons in BW25113 and MG1655 strains, respectively. more...

(Submitter supplied) Faithful transcription initiation is critical for accurate gene expression, yet the mechanisms underlying specific transcription start site (TSS) selection in mammals remain unclear. Here, we show that the histone-fold domain protein NF-Y, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, controls the fidelity of transcription initiation at gene promoters. We report that NF-Y maintains the region upstream of TSSs in a nucleosome-depleted state while simultaneously protecting this accessible region against aberrant and/or ectopic transcription initiation. more...

Previous publications reported this helicase to associate with AU-rich elements and to specifically unwind G-quadruplex structures. Here, we performed Ribosome footprintin in triplicats of HEK293 wildtype cells and DHX36-KO-HEK293 cells to identify changes in ribosome occupancy on mRNAs upon presence or absence of this helicase.

(Submitter supplied) Hcr1/eIF3j is a sub-stoichiometric subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) that can dissociate the post-termination 40S ribosomal subunit from mRNA in vitro. We examined this ribosome recycling role in vivo by ribosome profiling and reporter assays and found that loss of Hcr1 led to reinitiation of translation in 3’UTRs, consistent with a defect in recycling. However, the defect appeared to be in recycling of the 60S subunit, rather than the 40S subunit, because reinitiation did not require an AUG codon and was suppressed by overexpression of the 60S dissociation factor Rli1/ABCE1. more...

Here we show that Bacillus subtilis EF-P also alleviated ribosome pausing at sequences encoding tandem prolines, and ribosomes paused within several essential genes without a corresponding growth defect in an efp mutant. The B. subtilis efp mutant is instead impaired for flagellar biosynthesis which results in the abrogation of a form of motility called swarming. more...

Here we show that in budding yeast, under nutrient limiting conditions, the commonly used translation inhibitor cycloheximide induces rapid transcriptional upregulation of hundreds of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. more...

To evaluate the effect of SETD2 and METTL14 on translation, we conducted robosome profiling in SETD2 and METTL14 knockdown and control HepG2 cells. Our RNA ribosome profiling revealed that depletion of SETD2 and METTL14 resulted in a global reduction in RNA translation and the changes of translation efficiency were correlated between SETD2 and METTL14 knockdown cells.

487. Bias-minimized quantification of microRNA reveals widespread alternative processing and 3′ end modification
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate diverse biological and pathological processes via post-transcriptional gene silencing. High-throughput small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) has been widely adopted to investigate the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs. However, accurate quantification of miRNAs has been limited owing to the severe ligation bias in conventional sRNA-seq methods. Here we quantify miRNAs and their variants (known as isomiRs) by an improved sRNA-seq protocol, termed AQ-seq (accurate quantification by sequencing), that utilizes adapters with terminal degenerate sequences and a high concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which minimize the ligation bias during library preparation. more...

Although loss-of-function mutations in UFM1 conjugation are linked to ER stress, neither the biological function nor the relevant cellular targets of this protein modifier are known. Here we show that a largely uncharacterized ribosomal protein, RPL26, is the principal target of UFM1 conjugation. more...

489. Stoichiometric Production of Protein-Complex Components in Eukaryotes Without Widespread Feedback Regulation
(Submitter supplied) Constituents of multi-protein complexes are required at well-defined levels relative to each other. However, it remains unknown whether eukaryotic cells typically produce precise amounts of subunits, or instead rely on degradation to mitigate imprecise production. Here we quantified the production rates of multi-protein complexes in single- and multi-cellular eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. By resolving read-mapping ambiguities present in a large fraction of ribosome footprints which often distorts quantitation accuracy in eukaryotes, we found that obligate components of multi-protein complexes are produced in proportion to their stoichiometry, indicating that their abundances are already precisely tuned at the synthesis level. more...

However, some organisms express divergent rRNAs, the functional roles of which remain unknown. Here, we show that ribosomes containing the most variable rRNAs, encoded by the rrnI operon (herein designated I-ribosomes), direct the preferential translation of a subset of mRNAs in Vibrio vulnificus, enabling the rapid adaptation of bacteria to temperature and nutrient shifts. more...

In addition to the internal m6A, N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of capped mRNAs in vertebrates. However, its biogenesis and functional role remain elusive.

Indeed, overexpression of Ssd1 reduced protein synthesis in young cells and extended lifespan, while loss of Ssd1 reduced the translational deficit of old cells and shortened lifespan. more...

Here we examine the regulation of translation and mRNA stability in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during differentiation. In contrast to previous reports, we found that transcriptional changes account for most of the molecular changes during ESC differentiation. Within ESCs translation level and mRNA stability are positively correlated. more...

518. Translational control through differential ribosome pausing during amino acid limitation in mammalian cells
(Submitter supplied) Limitation for amino acids is thought to regulate translation in mammalian cells primarily by signaling through the kinases mTORC1 and GCN2. We find that limitation for the amino acid arginine causes a selective loss of tRNA charging, which regulates translation through ribosome pausing at two of six arginine codons. Interestingly, limitation for leucine, an essential and abundant amino acid in protein, results in little or no ribosome pausing. more...

Cells cope with this challenge by coupling synthesis with polypeptide folding and by employing molecular chaperones to safeguard folding already cotranslationally2. However, little is known about the final step of folding, the assembly of polypeptides into complexes, although most of the cellular proteome forms oligomeric assemblies3. more...

527. The dual methyltransferase METTL13 targets N-terminus and Lys55 of eEF1A and regulates codon-specific translation rates
(Submitter supplied) Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome and thereby plays a key role in protein synthesis. Human eEF1A is post-translationally methylated on several lysine residues as well as on the N-terminus and until recently the responsible methyltransferases were largely elusive. Using mass spectrometry based screens, gene targeted cells and in vitro enzymology we identify the human methyltransferase like proteins 13 (METTL13), which contains two distinct methyltransferase domains, as an enzyme catalyzing both dimethylation of Lys55 and trimethylation of the N-terminus of eEF1A. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ribosome biogenesis is a complex and intricate process involving multiple factors. A plethora of auxiliary proteins assist the correct assembly of rRNA and ribosomal proteins into mature ribosomes. Defects in this process cause dysfunctional ribosomes which may alter protein synthesis and impair cell fitness. Despite its importance, yet we are lacking mechanistic details of ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that the widely-conserved RNA chaperone Hfq, which is an important post-transcriptional regulator in sRNA-mRNA basepairing in Escherichia coli, plays a critical role in rRNA processing and consequently ribosome assembly. more...

543. Effects of single amino acid deficiency on mRNA translation are markedly different for methionine versus leucine
(Submitter supplied) Amino acid availability regulates translation through the action of the GCN2 and mTORC1 pathways. Low amino acids activate the eIF2α kinase GCN2 through binding of uncharged tRNAs to a histidyl-tRNA synthetase−related regulatory domain. Once activated GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2α, inhibiting ternary complex formation and translation initiation. Recent studies show that mTORC1 is particularly sensitive to arginine and leucine status, with a deprivation of these amino acids leading to a strong inhibition of mTORC1 that prevents the phosphorylation and inactivation of the translational repressor 4EBP1. more...

(Submitter supplied) Dynamic post-transcriptional control of RNA expression by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is critical during immune response. ZFP36 RBPs are prominent inflammatory regulators linked to autoimmunity and cancer, but functions in adaptive immunity are less clear. We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in T-cells, which confirmed regulation of cytokine expression and revealed unanticipated actions in regulating T-cell activation and proliferation. more...

550. Consequences of Ribosomal Protein Haploinsufficiency in Human Hematopoiesis
(Submitter supplied) Ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency (RPH) underlies diverse human diseases with distinct and specific phenotypes, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the erythroid-specific hematopoietic defects observed in DBA, only recently has the role of selectively impaired translation been highlighted in these phenotypes. Exactly how and to what extent this impairment of translation occurs is currently unknown. more...

551. Pervasive, coordinated protein level changes driven by transcript isoform switching during meiosis
(Submitter supplied) To better understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that program developmental processes, we carried out simultaneous, genome-wide measurements of mRNA, translation and protein through meiotic differentiation in budding yeast. Surprisingly, we observed that the levels of several hundred mRNAs are anti-correlated with their corresponding protein products. We show that rather than arising from canonical forms of gene regulatory control, the regulation of at least 380 such cases—or over 8% of all measured genes—involves temporally regulated switching between production of a canonical, translatable transcript and a 5' extended isoform that is not efficiently translated into protein. more...

552. Translational control of ERK signalling pathway by the mRNA cap-binding protein 4EHP
(Submitter supplied) microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing is commonly deregulated in a wide variety of diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of how miRNAs govern the translation and stability of mRNAs is of paramount importance. We recently demonstrated that the cap-binding protein 4EHP is recruited by the miRNA machinery to effect translational repression. However, the impact of 4EHP on regulation of endogenous mRNAs and its role in cell biology is debated. more...

(Submitter supplied) The development of the ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) technique has enabled the measurement of translation at a genome-wide level. There are several variants of the ribosome profiling technique that use different translation inhibitors. The regular ribo-seq utilizes Cycloheximide (CHX), a translation elongation inhibitor to freeze all translating ribosomes. In contrast to CHX, the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM) and harringtonine (Harr) have a much stronger effect on initiating ribosomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) The signal recognition particle (SRP) enables cotranslational delivery of proteins for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but its full in vivo role remains incompletely explored. We combined rapid auxin-induced SRP degradation with proximity-specific ribosome profiling to define SRP’s in vivo function in yeast. Despite the classic view that SRP recognizes amino-terminal signal sequences, we show that SRP was generally essential for targeting transmembrane domains regardless of their position relative to the amino-terminus. more...

However, this phenomenon hasn't been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. more...

(Submitter supplied) Roquin proteins are required to preclude spontaneous T cell activation and aberrant T follicular helper (Tfh) or T helper 17 (Th17) differentiation. Here, we show that deletion of Roquin encoding alleles in regulatory T cells (Tregs) also caused the activation of conventional T cells. These Tregs exhibited a follicular Treg phenotype, CD25 downregulation and could not protect from colitis. Mechanistically, Roquin was required for full expression and activity of Pten and Foxo1, two essential signaling molecules in Tregs and effector T cells. more...

In this study, we developed a new feasible method measuring poly(A)-tail length called TED-seq and applied it to investigate the change of mRNA's poly(A)-tail lengths in ER stress pharmacologically induced by thapsigargin (THAP). Combined with other global RNA analyses such as RNA-seq, Ribo-seq and PRO-seq, we observed that ER stress induced lenthening poly(A)-tail length, in particular of ER-stress-regulators, upon ER stress. more...

Using total RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, we have characterized the transcriptional and translational scope of B cells infected with EBV. We could show that viral transcripts are translated at variable efficiency and that several viral genes show ribosome recruitment to the 5’ leader region of mRNAs. We used two different virus strains with differing in vitro characteristics to study EBV translation and could show that in cells infected with the weakly replicating EBV strain some lytic genes showed evidence of monosomal ribosome recruitment mainly in the 5’ leader region and on start codons in the absence of protein production. more...

569. Comparative ribosome profiling uncovers a dominant role for translational control in Toxoplasma gondii
(Submitter supplied) The lytic cycle of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which involves a brief sojourn in the extracellular space, is characterized by defined transcriptional profiles. For an obligate intracellular parasite that is shielded from the cytosolic host immune factors by a parasitophorous vacuole, the brief entry into the extracellular space is likely to exert enormous stress. Due to its role in cellular stress response, we hypothesize that translational control plays an important role in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma during the lytic cycle. more...

582. N6-Methyladenosine Guides mRNA Alternative Translation during Integrated Stress Response
(Submitter supplied) The integrated stress response (ISR) facilitates cellular adaptation to a variety of stress conditions via phosphorylation of the common target eIF2α. During ISR, the translation of certain stress-related mRNAs is upregulated in spite of global suppression of protein synthesis.The selective translation often relieson alternative mechanisms, such as leaky scanning or reinitiation, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. more...

595. Scope and mechanism of eIF4F-independent mRNA translation
(Submitter supplied) In eukaryotic cells, protein synthesis typically begins with the binding of eIF4F to the 7-methylguanylate (m7G)cap found on the 5’ end of the majority of mRNAs. Surprisingly, overall translational output remains robust under eIF4F inhibition. The sustained protein synthesis has been largely attributed to cap-independent translation mediated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). However, the IRES-driven translation is substrate-specific and largely incompatible with the broad spectrum of eIF4F-resistant translatomes.Here, we report that N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-mediated translation prevails on capped mRNAs and is resistant to eIF4F inactivation.Depletion of the methyltransferase METTL3 selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs bearing 5’UTR methylation, but not mRNAs with 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) elements. more...

We used N. crassa cell-free extracts and obtained data indicating that cpc-1 uORF1 and uORF2 are functionally analogous to GCN4 uORF1 and uORF4 in controlling translation. more...

617. Domestic chickens activate a piRNA defense against avian leukosis virus
(Submitter supplied) PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) protect the germ line by targeting transposable elements (TEs) through base-pair complementarity. We do not know how piRNAs co-evolve with TEs in chickens. Here we reported that all active TEs in the chicken germ line are targeted by piRNAs, and as TEs lose their activity, the corresponding piRNAs erode away. We observed de novo piRNA birth as host responds to a recent retroviral invasion. more...

Using a combination of ribosome profiling and in vitro biochemistry, we report a much broader role for eIF5A in elongation and uncover a substantial function for eIF5A in termination. Ribosome profiling of an eIF5A-depleted strain reveals a global elongation defect, with abundant ribosomes stalling at many sequences, not limited to proline stretches. more...

The three bacterial release factors (RFs) play key roles:  RF1 and 2 recognize stop codons and terminate translation; and RF3 promotes disassociation of bound release factors. Probing release factors mutations with reporter constructs containing programmed frameshifting sequences or premature stop codons had revealed a propensity for readthrough or frameshifting at these specific sites, but their effects on translation genome-wide have not been examined. more...

628. Intragenic DNA methylation prevents cryptic transcription initiations on gene bodies [ART-seq]
(Submitter supplied) In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mainly at 5mC of CpG dinucleotides. The methylation on the promoter leads to the suppression of gene expression, while the functional role of gene body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here, we show that the Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation protects the gene body from RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) spurious entry and cryptic transcription initiation. more...

(Submitter supplied) While NGS allows rapid global detection of transcripts, it remains difficult to distinguish ncRNAs from short mRNAs. To detect potentially translated RNAs, we developed an improved protocol for bacterial ribosomal footprinting (RIBOseq). This allowed distinguishing ncRNA from mRNA in EHEC. A high ratio of ribosomal footprints per transcript (ribosomal coverage value, RCV) is expected to indicate a translated RNA, while a low RCV should point to a non-translated RNA. more...

The regulatory processes that shape the platelet transcriptome and the full scope of platelet translation have remained elusive. Using RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling of primary human platelets, we show the platelet transcriptome encompasses a subset of transcripts detected by RNA-Seq analysis of in vitro derived MK cells and these platelet-enriched transcripts are broadly occupied by ribosomes. more...

Individual ORFs on the mRNA are differentially translated, with rates varying as much as 100-fold. The signals controlling differential translation are poorly understood. Our genome-wide mRNA secondary structure analysis indicated that operonic mRNAs are comprised of ORF-wide units of secondary structure that vary across ORF boundaries such that adjacent ORFs on the same mRNA molecule are structurally distinct. more...

(Submitter supplied) Lysine methylation is abundant on histone proteins, representing a dynamic regulator of chromatin state and gene activity, but is also frequent on many nonhistone proteins, including eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A). However, the functional significance of eEF1Amethylation remains obscure and it has remained unclear whether eEF1A methylation is dynamic and subject to active regulation. We here demonstrate, using a wide range of in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the previously uncharacterized human methyltransferase METTL21B specifically targets Lys-165 in eEF1A in an aminoacyl-tRNA- and GTP-dependent manner. more...

650. Translation efficiency is maintained during heat shock in Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) We utilize ribosome profiling to directly monitor translation in E. coli at 30 °C and investigate how this changes after 10-20 minutes of heat shock at 42 °C. Translation is controlled by the interplay of several RNA hybridization processes, which are expected to be temperature sensitive. We observe that translation efficiencies are robustly maintained after thermal heat shock and after mimicking the heat shock response transcriptional program at 30 °C.

661. Ribonuclease Selection for Ribosome Profiling
(Submitter supplied) Ribosome profiling has emerged as a powerful method to assess global gene translation, but methodological and analytical challenges often lead to inconsistencies across labs and model organisms. A critical issue in ribosome profiling is nuclease treatment of ribosome-mRNA complexes, as it is important to ensure both stability of ribosomal particles and complete conversion of polysomes to monosomes. We performed comparative ribosome profiling in yeast and mice with various ribonucleases including I, A, S7 and T1, characterized their cutting preferences, trinucleotide periodicity patterns, and coverage similarities across coding sequences, and showed that they yield comparable estimations of gene expression when ribosome integrity is not compromised. However, ribosome coverage patterns of individual transcripts had little in common between the ribonucleases. We further examined their potency at converting polysomes to monosomes across other commonly used model organisms, including bacteria, nematodes and fruit flies. In some cases, ribonuclease treatment completely degraded ribosome populations. Ribonuclease T1 was the only enzyme that preserved ribosomal integrity while thoroughly converting polysomes to monosomes in all examined species. This study provides a guide for ribonuclease selection in ribosome profiling experiments across most common model systems

(Submitter supplied) Rocaglamide A (RocA) typifies a novel class of protein synthesis inhibitors that selectively kill aneuploid tumor cells and repress translation of specific mRNAs. RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), the prototypical DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its mRNA selectivity is proposed to reflect highly structured 5′ UTRs that are very dependent on eIF4A-mediated unwinding. Here, we show that secondary structure in 5′ UTRs is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and RocA does not repress translation by reducing eIF4A activity. more...

679. Ligation-Free Ribosome Profiling Reveals Cell Type-Specific Regulation of Protein Synthesis in the Brain
(Submitter supplied) Ribosome profiling has emerged as a powerful tool for genome-wide measurements of translation, but library construction requires multiple ligation steps and remains cumbersome relative to more conventional deep sequencing experiments. We report a new approach to ribosome profiling that does not require ligation. Library construction for ligation-free ribosome profiling can be completed in one day with as little as 1 ng of purified RNA footprints. more...

681. eIF4B preferentially stimulates translation of long mRNAs with structured 5’UTRs and low closed-loop potential but weak dependence on eIF4G
(Submitter supplied) DEAD-box RNA helicases eIF4A and Ded1 promote translation by resolving mRNA secondary structures that impede preinitiation complex (PIC) attachment to mRNA or scanning. eIF4B is a cofactor for eIF4A but might also function independently of eIF4A. Ribosome profiling of mutants lacking eIF4B or with impaired eIF4A or Ded1 activity revealed that eliminating eIF4B reduces the relative translational efficiencies of many more genes than does inactivation of eIF4A, despite comparable reductions in bulk translation, and few genes display unusually strong requirements for both factors. more...

682. The RNA-binding protein TTP is a global post-transcriptional regulator of feedback control in inflammation [Ribo-seq]

The RBP tristetraprolin (TTP/Zfp36) is a signal-induced phosphorylated anti-inflammatory protein guiding unstable mRNAs of pro-inflammatory proteins for degradation and preventing translation. Using iCLIP, we have identified numerous mRNA targets bound by wild-type TTP and by a non-MK2-phosphorylatable TTP mutant (TTP-AA) in 1h LPS-stimulated macrophages and correlated their interaction with TTP to changes at the level of mRNA abundance and translation in a transcriptome-wide manner. more...

687. Ribosome profiling study of Dhh1p overexpression and the dhh1 knockout strain using monosome-protected footprints
(Submitter supplied) A major determinant of mRNA half-life is the codon-dependent rate of translational elongation. How the processes of translational elongation and mRNA decay communicate is unclear. In this study we establish that the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1p is the sensor of codon optimality (i.e. translational elongation rate) that targets an mRNA for decay. First, we find that mRNAs whose translation elongation rate is slowed by inclusion of non-optimal codons are specifically degraded in a DHH1-dependent manner. more...

There has been remarkable evolutionary adaptation of this machine through the addition of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins whose individual effects on ribosome function are largely unknown. Here we show that eukaryote-specific Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs with short open reading frames that show greater than average translational efficiency in diverse eukaryotes. more...

Intriguingly, however, a cancer-related DDX3 variant DDX3 R534H selectively preserves translation of genes encoding core nucleosome components. Additionally, DDX3 variants also shift ORF usage on select genes, such as RPLP1 and stress-response factors as an added mechanism of translation regulation during stress. more...

RNA-seq and ribosome profiling were used to measure global messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance and translation levels throughout the Caulobacter cell cycle revealing translational control in 51% of cell cycle-regulated genes.   Ribosome profiling levels were temporally regulated for ten proteins encoding asymmetrically localized multi-protein assemblies that specify cell fate upon cell division, with five ORFs being regulated with a >2 fold contribution from the translation efficiency. more...

692. A coding sequence-embedded principle governs translational reading frame fidelity
(Submitter supplied) Upon initiation at an AUG start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3’ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. more...

Using TAIL-seq and ribosome profiling, we investigate poly(A) tail dynamics and translational control in the somatic cell cycle. We find dramatic changes in poly(A) tail lengths of cell cycle regulatory genes like CDK1, TOP2A, and FBXO5, explaining their translational repression in M phase. more...

Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that mTOR exclusively stimulates translation of TOP (containing a 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine [5’TOP] motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling implied that mTOR also modulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. We show that ribosome-, but not polysome-profiling, is biased towards identification of TOP mRNAs as differentially translated while obscuring detection of changes in non-TOP mRNA translation. more...

In this study, we develop a chemical kinetic model that calculates a protein domain’s co-translational folding curve using only the domain’s bulk folding and unfolding rates and codon translation rates. We show that this model accurately predicts the course of co-translational folding measured in vivo for four different protein molecules. more...

Here, we revisit an earlier report that Shine-Dalgarno sequences are the major determinant of translational pausing in bacteria. Using refinements in the profiling method as well as biochemical assays, we find that SD motifs have little (if any) effect on elongation rates. more...

Here, we examine RNA species expressed in male reproductive tissues of mice. Protein restriction leads to altered levels of multiple small RNAs in mature sperm, as well as throughout the male reproductive tract, with decreased levels of let-7 family members and increased levels of 5’ fragments of tRNA-Gly isoacceptors. more...

Automated annotation strategies rely on assumptions about protein-coding sequences (CDSs), e.g., they are conserved, do not overlap, and exceed a minimum length. However, an increasing number of newly discovered proteins violate these rules. Here we present an experimental and analytical framework, based on ribosome profiling and linear regression, for systematic identification and quantification of translation. more...

Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-seq) maps the positions of translating ribosomes over the entire transcriptome. Despite its great potential, a rigorous statistical approach to identify translated regions from Ribo-seq data is not yet available. To fill this gap, we developed RiboTaper, which quantifies the significance of the three-nucleotide periodicity of Ribo-seq reads via spectral analysis methods.

In order to reveal the signature of cellular genes that are manipulated by HCMV, we measured RNA abundance and rate of protein production through the course of HCMV infection. We characterized changes for most expressed cellular genes and although much of the regulation was transcriptional we uncover diverse and dynamic translational regulation for subsets of host genes, revealing unappreciated coordination in translational control that suggests common regulators

(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal messenger (mRNA) modification in mammalian mRNA. This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric, which potentially adds an additional layer of variety and dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The m6A-modified mRNA can be selectively recognized by the YTH family “reader” proteins. The preferential binding of m6A-containing mRNA by YTHDF2 is known to reduce the stability of the target transcripts; however, the exact effects of m6A on translation has yet to be elucidated. more...

753. Optimization of codon translation rates via tRNA modifications maintains proteome integrity
(Submitter supplied) Proteins begin to fold as they emerge from translating ribosomes. The kinetics of ribosome transit along a given mRNA can influence nascent chain folding, but the extent to which individual codon translation rates impact proteome integrity remains unknown. Here, we show that slower decoding of discrete codons elicits widespread protein aggregation in vivo. Using ribosome profiling, we find that loss of anticodon wobble uridine (U34) modifications in a subset of tRNAs leads to ribosome pausing at their cognate codons in S. more...

(Submitter supplied) ABCE1/Rli1 functions as a ribosome recycling factor in vitro, but has not been shown to be crucial for recycling in vivo. We use ribosome profiling and biochemistry to define the role of Rli1 in living yeast. When Rli1 levels were diminished, 80S ribosomes accumulated at stop codons and, surprisingly, in the adjoining 3'UTRs of most genes. While ribosomes did not show preference for any reading frame in the 3'UTR, their enrichment at stop codons and His codons after histidine starvation is consistent with aberrant 3'UTR translation. more...

ISRIB renders cells resistant to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances long-term memory in rodents (10.7554/eLife.00498).  Here we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation.

779. The general mode of translation inhibition by macrolide antibiotics
(Submitter supplied) Macrolides are clinically important antibiotics thought to inhibit bacterial growth by impeding the passage of newly synthesized polypeptides through the nascent peptide exit tunnel of the bacterial ribosome. Recent data challenged this view by showing that macrolide antibiotics can differentially affect synthesis of individual proteins. In order to understand the general mechanism of macrolide action, we used genome-wide ribosome profiling and analyzed the redistribution of ribosomes translating highly expressed genes in bacterial cells treated with high concentrations of macrolide antibiotics. more...

Here we identify Mettl3, an N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) transferase, as a regulator for terminating murine naïve pluripotency. Mettl3 knockout pre-implantation epiblasts and naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are depleted for m6A in mRNAs and yet, are viable. more...

783. mRNA destabilization is the dominant effect of mammalian microRNAs by the time substantial repression ensues (sequencing)
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate target mRNAs through a combination of translational repression and mRNA destabilization, with mRNA destabilization dominating at steady state in the few contexts examined globally. Here, we extend the global steady-state measurements to additional mammalian contexts and find that regardless of the miRNA, cell type, growth condition, or translational state, mRNA destabilization explains most (66%–>90%) miRNA-mediated repression. more...

785. Translational profiling in the unfolded protein response
(Submitter supplied) The unfolded protein response (UPR) couples cellular translation rates and gene expression to the protein folding status of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon activation, the UPR machinery elicits a general suppression of protein synthesis and activation of stress gene expression, which act coordinately to restore protein folding homeostasis. We report here that UPR activation promotes the release of signal sequence-encoding mRNAs from the ER to the cytosol as a mechanism to decrease protein influx into the ER. more...

787. Ribosome Profiling Reveals Pervasive Translation Outside of Annotated Protein-Coding Genes
(Submitter supplied) Ribosome profiling suggests that ribosomes occupy many regions of the transcriptome thought to be non-coding, including 5' UTRs and lncRNAs. Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. more...

Methods: Tissue homogenates were prepared from frozen sections of a muscle biopsy obtained from a patient with an NM_004006:c.40_41delGA dystrophin mutation and a normal control.  Ribosome-protected fragments and total RNA were prepared from a single homogenate, so starting RNA populations for both libraries were closely matched. more...

Using this novel method, several studies have demonstrated the widespread role of short upstream reading frames in translational control as well as slower elongation at the beginning of open reading frames in response to stress. Based on the initial studies, the importance of adding or omitting translation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, was noted as it markedly affected ribosome coverage profiles. more...

791. Ribosome profiling upon glucose starvation in S. cerevisiae
(Submitter supplied) A universal feature of the response to stress and nutrient limitation is transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding proteins important for survival.  Interestingly, under many of these conditions overall protein synthesis levels are reduced, thereby dampening the stress response at the level of protein expression. For example, during glucose starvation in yeast, translation is rapidly and reversibly repressed, yet transcription of many stress- and glucose-repressed genes is increased. more...

812. Transcription in Pronuclei and One- to Four-Cell Embryos Drives Early Development in a Nematode
(Submitter supplied) A long-standing view of development is that transcription is silenced in the oocyte until early divisions in the embryo. The point at which major transcription is reactivated varies in different organisms, but is usually after the 2-cell stage. However, this model may not be universal. We used RNA-seq and exploited the protracted development of the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum, to provide a comprehensive time course of mRNA expression, degradation, and translation during early development. more...

816. Ribosome profiling study of dom34 and hbs1 knockout strains using short (16-nt) and long (28-nt) monosome-protected footprints and disome-protected footprints
(Submitter supplied) Ribosomes that stall before completing peptide synthesis must be recycled and returned to the cytoplasmic pool. The protein Dom34 and cofactors Hbs1 and Rli1 can dissociate stalled ribosomes in vitro, but the identity of targets in the cell is unknown. Here we use ribosome profiling methodology to reveal a high- resolution molecular characterization of Dom34 function in vivo. We show that Dom34 removes stalled ribosomes from mRNAs that are truncated but, in contrast, does not generally dissociate ribosomes on coding sequences known to trigger stalling, such as polyproline. more...

Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in Drosophila melanogaster, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for Drosophila melanogaster, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. more...

821. m6A-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes. Here we present that m6A is selectively recognized by human YTH domain family (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs.

Transient pausing of ribosomes can impact a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the mRNA. Thus redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. more...

We monitored the impact of miR-430 on ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in wild type and dicer mutants lacking mature miR-430. Our results indicate that miR-430 reduces the number of ribosomes on target mRNAs before causing mRNA decay. more...

846. The translational landscape of mTOR signaling steers cancer initiation and metastasis
(Submitter supplied) The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a master regulator of protein synthesis that couples nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer. However, the downstream translationally regulated nodes of gene expression that may direct cancer development are poorly characterized. Employing ribosome profiling we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signaling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism, and invasion. more...

847. High-resolution view of the yeast meiotic program revealed by ribosome profiling
(Submitter supplied) Meiosis is a complex developmental process that generates haploid cells from diploid progenitors. We measured mRNA abundance and protein production through yeast sporulation and found strong temporal control for most genes, achieved through both mRNA levels and translational regulation. Monitoring the timing of protein production revealed novel factors involved in recombination and helped to illuminate the molecular basis of the broad restructuring of meiotic cells. more...

848. Ribosome footprinting in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum
(Submitter supplied) In eukaryotic cells, the spatial regulation of protein expression is frequently conferred through the coupling of mRNA localization and the local control of translation. mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a prominent example of such regulation and serves a ubiquitous role in segregating the synthesis of secretory and integral membrane proteins to the ER. Recent genomic and biochemical studies have now expanded this view to suggest a role for the ER in global protein synthesis. more...

849. Selective ribosome profiling reveals the co-translational chaperone action of trigger factor in vivo
(Submitter supplied) As nascent polypeptides exit ribosomes, they are engaged by a series of processing, targeting and folding factors. Here we present a selective ribosome profiling strategy that enables global monitoring of when these factors engage polypeptides in the complex cellular environment. Studies of the Escherichia coli chaperone Trigger Factor (TF) reveal that, while TF can interact with many polypeptides, β-barrel outer membrane proteins are the most prominent substrates. more...

(Submitter supplied) Recent studies have revealed that the mRNA translation is punctuated by ribosomal pauses through the body of transcripts.  However, little is known about its physiological significance and regulatory aspects.  Here we present a multi-dimensional ribosome profiling approach to quantify the dynamics of initiation and elongation of 80S ribosomes across the entire transcriptome in mammalian cells.  We show that a subset of transcripts have a significant pausing of 80S ribosome around the start codon, creating a major barrier to the commitment of translation elongation. more...

853. Ribosome Profiling of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Reveals the Complexity of Mammalian Proteomes
(Submitter supplied) The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the  information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep-sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein  synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit  the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation  together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. more...
