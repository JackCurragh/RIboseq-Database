The Cas9 single clone of HEK293T cells with sgRNA against METTL16 (and scramble control) were expanded in DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1 X penicillin-streptomycin, plasmocin prophylactic, 10 ug/ml blasticidin, and 2 ug/ml puromycin for at least one week and the cells were collected at 70-80% confluency in 150 mm dish.

The ribosomes from the cell lysates were collected by ultracentrifugation and the ribosome footprints (17-34nts) were recovered from polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel.
The end structures of the RNA fragments were repaired by T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK, M0201S, New England Biolabs): (1) 3’ end healing reaction (10 μl): 7 μl RNA sample, 1 μl 10×T4 PNK buffer, 1 μl T4 PNK, and 1 μl SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 37 ℃; (2) 5’-end phosphorylation: 1 μl 10 mM ATP and 1 μl extra T4 PNK were added to the reaction and the mixture was kept for 30 min at 37 ℃. The RNA was purified by ethanol precipitation. The libraries were constructed after depletion of rRNA, and sequenced on Illumina Hiseq2500 with single end 51-bp read length.

The cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 5 min at 37 ℃ to prevent translation before standard ribosome profiling protocol.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Cas9 single clone of HEK293T cells with sgRNA against METTL16 (and scramble control) were expanded in DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1 X penicillin-streptomycin, plasmocin prophylactic, 10 ug/ml blasticidin, and 2 ug/ml puromycin for at least one week and the cells were collected at 70-80% confluency in 150 mm dish.

The ribosomes from the cell lysates were collected by ultracentrifugation and the ribosome footprints (17-34nts) were recovered from polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel.
The end structures of the RNA fragments were repaired by T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK, M0201S, New England Biolabs): (1) 3’ end healing reaction (10 μl): 7 μl RNA sample, 1 μl 10×T4 PNK buffer, 1 μl T4 PNK, and 1 μl SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 37 ℃; (2) 5’-end phosphorylation: 1 μl 10 mM ATP and 1 μl extra T4 PNK were added to the reaction and the mixture was kept for 30 min at 37 ℃. The RNA was purified by ethanol precipitation. The libraries were constructed after depletion of rRNA, and sequenced on Illumina Hiseq2500 with single end 51-bp read length.

    <Title>Determine the effects of METTL16 on global translation efficiency via ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq)</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE156796</Accession>
    <Summary>
METTL16 is a member of methyltransferase like (METTL) family. Unlike well-studied METTL3 and METTL14, we found a much higher percentage of METTL16 is localized in the cytosol. The subcellular distribution holds the ability to potentiate translation efficiency. Via Far-western blotting and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays, we have identified the direct interactions between METTL16 and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) a and b. Via cross-linking immunoprecipitation and qPCR (CLIP-qPCR), we have discovered the direct associations between METTL16 and rRNAs. The METTL16-eIF3a/b and METTL16-rRNAs interactions induce the binding between eIF3 and 18S rRNA, promote the formation of 43S preinitiation complex, and eventually expedite translation initiation, the rate-limiting step of translation. To determine the exact effects of METTL16 on translation efficiency, we performed ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) with HEK293T upon CRISPR-Cas9-induced METTL16 knockout. To guarantee the repeatability and avoid any potential off-target effects, we included 3 distint sgRNAs against METTL16.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The Cas9 single clone of HEK293T cells was infected with lentivirus sgRNAs against METTL16 and the cells were collected at 70-80% confluency after selection with blasticidin and puromycin for at least 1 week. The samples were subjected to ribosome profiling and both the input RNA and footprint RNAs were used for sequencing. Three sgRNAs against METTL16 groups and one sgNS group were included.
