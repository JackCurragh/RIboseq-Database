      <Treatment-Protocol>
The mouse and human siEbp1 oligos were obtained from the Dharmacon SMARTpool ON-TARGETplus collection (mouse siPa2g4 #18813, L-042883-01-0005; human siPa2g4 #5036; L008860-00-0005) and compared to non-targeting siRNA control (D-001810-10-05). Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher, 13778075) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Neuro2a cultures were prepared in biological triplicate, with 3x 10 cm plates per control and knockdown (mouse siEbp1) conditions. Growth in standard DMEM (Gibco, 31966047) with 10 % FBS (Gibco, 10270106) and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122) to a confluence of 90 % in humidified 37 °C, 5 % CO2.

400 µl mammalian polysome buffer (20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 1 % Triton X-100 and 25 U/mL TurboDNase (Thermo Fisher, AM2238]) was added to each plate, which were then placed on ice. Cells were scraped into a slurry, and then passed 10 times through a 26 G needle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20000 xg, 10 min, 4 °C). Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments were generated by adding 300 U RNase-I (Thermo Fisher, EN0601) for 45 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.
For total RNAseq, sequencing libraries were constructed with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, E7420L) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For Riboseq sequencing library preparation, the RNA was first ligated to a 3’ adapter 4N-RA3 (see below), and gel-purified using a 15 % denaturing urea-PAGE gel (Carl Roth). Next the 5’ adapter OR5-4N (see below) was ligated and gel purified. The RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified by Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fischer, F-530XL). The cDNA was visualized on a 2.5 % agarose gel, a ~150 bp sized fragment was excised and purified by Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery kit (Zymo Research, D4007/D4008).

Library strategy: Ribo-seq
Riboseq reads were stripped of adaptor sequences using cutdapt, and contaminants such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and rRNA were removed by alignment to a contaminants index via STAR 2.7.0, consisting of nucleotide sequences from known mouse rRNA and tRNA sequences drawn from the gencode annotation.
Unaligned reads from this analysis were then aligned to mouse genome version GRCm38 with the STAR v 2.7.0 splice-aware alignment tool allowing for up to 1 mismatch. The star genome index was built using GENCODE M12. Only uniquely aligning reads were used.
The RiboseQC pipeline v1.1 (https://github.com/ohlerlab/RiboseQC) was used to confirm 3-nucleotide periodicity of the data and deduce P-site positions from the Riboseq reads.
Ribosome P-site count metaplots and fold change were calculated by first normalizing the P-site coverage track for each gene to the gene's total density, excluding genes with &lt; 32 reads or less (low count filtering), and then all genes’ tracks were added together to generate a mean P-site density at each point for each sample. Confidence intervals were calculated by resampling from the 3 replicates for each condition.

400 µl mammalian polysome buffer (20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 1 % Triton X-100 and 25 U/mL TurboDNase (Thermo Fisher, AM2238]) was added to each plate, which were then placed on ice. Cells were scraped into a slurry, and then passed 10 times through a 26 G needle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20000 xg, 10 min, 4 °C). Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments were generated by adding 300 U RNase-I (Thermo Fisher, EN0601) for 45 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.
For total RNAseq, sequencing libraries were constructed with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, E7420L) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For Riboseq sequencing library preparation, the RNA was first ligated to a 3’ adapter 4N-RA3 (see below), and gel-purified using a 15 % denaturing urea-PAGE gel (Carl Roth). Next the 5’ adapter OR5-4N (see below) was ligated and gel purified. The RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified by Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fischer, F-530XL). The cDNA was visualized on a 2.5 % agarose gel, a ~150 bp sized fragment was excised and purified by Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery kit (Zymo Research, D4007/D4008).

Riboseq reads were stripped of adaptor sequences using cutdapt, and contaminants such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and rRNA were removed by alignment to a contaminants index via STAR 2.7.0, consisting of nucleotide sequences from known mouse rRNA and tRNA sequences drawn from the gencode annotation.
Unaligned reads from this analysis were then aligned to mouse genome version GRCm38 with the STAR v 2.7.0 splice-aware alignment tool allowing for up to 1 mismatch. The star genome index was built using GENCODE M12. Only uniquely aligning reads were used.
The RiboseQC pipeline v1.1 (https://github.com/ohlerlab/RiboseQC) was used to confirm 3-nucleotide periodicity of the data and deduce P-site positions from the Riboseq reads.
Ribosome P-site count metaplots and fold change were calculated by first normalizing the P-site coverage track for each gene to the gene's total density, excluding genes with &lt; 32 reads or less (low count filtering), and then all genes’ tracks were added together to generate a mean P-site density at each point for each sample. Confidence intervals were calculated by resampling from the 3 replicates for each condition.

Ebp1 siRNA knockdown oligo transfection
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
The mouse and human siEbp1 oligos were obtained from the Dharmacon SMARTpool ON-TARGETplus collection (mouse siPa2g4 #18813, L-042883-01-0005; human siPa2g4 #5036; L008860-00-0005) and compared to non-targeting siRNA control (D-001810-10-05). Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher, 13778075) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Neuro2a cultures were prepared in biological triplicate, with 3x 10 cm plates per control and knockdown (mouse siEbp1) conditions. Growth in standard DMEM (Gibco, 31966047) with 10 % FBS (Gibco, 10270106) and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122) to a confluence of 90 % in humidified 37 °C, 5 % CO2.

400 µl mammalian polysome buffer (20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 1 % Triton X-100 and 25 U/mL TurboDNase (Thermo Fisher, AM2238]) was added to each plate, which were then placed on ice. Cells were scraped into a slurry, and then passed 10 times through a 26 G needle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20000 xg, 10 min, 4 °C). Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments were generated by adding 300 U RNase-I (Thermo Fisher, EN0601) for 45 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.
For total RNAseq, sequencing libraries were constructed with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, E7420L) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For Riboseq sequencing library preparation, the RNA was first ligated to a 3’ adapter 4N-RA3 (see below), and gel-purified using a 15 % denaturing urea-PAGE gel (Carl Roth). Next the 5’ adapter OR5-4N (see below) was ligated and gel purified. The RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified by Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fischer, F-530XL). The cDNA was visualized on a 2.5 % agarose gel, a ~150 bp sized fragment was excised and purified by Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery kit (Zymo Research, D4007/D4008).

    <Data-Processing>
Riboseq reads were stripped of adaptor sequences using cutdapt, and contaminants such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and rRNA were removed by alignment to a contaminants index via STAR 2.7.0, consisting of nucleotide sequences from known mouse rRNA and tRNA sequences drawn from the gencode annotation.
Unaligned reads from this analysis were then aligned to mouse genome version GRCm38 with the STAR v 2.7.0 splice-aware alignment tool allowing for up to 1 mismatch. The star genome index was built using GENCODE M12. Only uniquely aligning reads were used.
The RiboseQC pipeline v1.1 (https://github.com/ohlerlab/RiboseQC) was used to confirm 3-nucleotide periodicity of the data and deduce P-site positions from the Riboseq reads.
Ribosome P-site count metaplots and fold change were calculated by first normalizing the P-site coverage track for each gene to the gene's total density, excluding genes with &lt; 32 reads or less (low count filtering), and then all genes’ tracks were added together to generate a mean P-site density at each point for each sample. Confidence intervals were calculated by resampling from the 3 replicates for each condition.
