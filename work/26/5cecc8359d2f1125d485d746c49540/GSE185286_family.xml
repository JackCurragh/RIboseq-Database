      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were collected by vacuum filtration, separated from the filter with a plastic scraper and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and ground with a pestle with addition of polysome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) with constant addition of liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) at 30℃ and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage (OD=0.5-0.6).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Cell lysates were clarified by two sequential centrifugation steps - 3000g, 5 minutes, 4℃, and 20000g, 10 minutes, 4℃. Part of the cell lysate was used for mRNA isolation using Oligo(dT) beads.  Another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to a linear 10-50% sucrose gradient in fractionation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) and separated on a SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 35000 rpm, 3 hours, 4℃. Subsequently, ribosome-bound RNA fragments were collected from the monosome fraction. Ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Kasari et al., 2019 DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkz600). Importantly, cycloheximide was added to the lysis buffer but not to the growth media.

Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10 with the following parameters for RNA-Seq (-a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --minimum-length 20 -q 20) and Ribo-Seq samples (-a CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --trimmed-only -q 20).
Additionally for Ribo-Seq, the reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1, and unique barcodes were then removed with cutadapt v. 2.10 (-q 20 --minimum-length 20 -u -4).
Afterwards, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequence set obtained from silva-euk and rfam databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3. Only unmapped non-rRNA reads were saved for the further analysis.
Read mapping and counting against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly was performed with STAR v. 2.7.9a.

Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10 with the following parameters for RNA-Seq (-a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --minimum-length 20 -q 20) and Ribo-Seq samples (-a CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --trimmed-only -q 20).
Additionally for Ribo-Seq, the reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1, and unique barcodes were then removed with cutadapt v. 2.10 (-q 20 --minimum-length 20 -u -4).
Afterwards, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequence set obtained from silva-euk and rfam databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3. Only unmapped non-rRNA reads were saved for the further analysis.
Read mapping and counting against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly was performed with STAR v. 2.7.9a.

Cells were collected by vacuum filtration, separated from the filter with a plastic scraper and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and ground with a pestle with addition of polysome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) with constant addition of liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) at 30℃ and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage (OD=0.5-0.6).

Cell lysates were clarified by two sequential centrifugation steps - 3000g, 5 minutes, 4℃, and 20000g, 10 minutes, 4℃. Part of the cell lysate was used for mRNA isolation using Oligo(dT) beads.  Another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to a linear 10-50% sucrose gradient in fractionation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) and separated on a SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 35000 rpm, 3 hours, 4℃. Subsequently, ribosome-bound RNA fragments were collected from the monosome fraction. Ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Kasari et al., 2019 DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkz600). Importantly, cycloheximide was added to the lysis buffer but not to the growth media.

Cells were collected by vacuum filtration, separated from the filter with a plastic scraper and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and ground with a pestle with addition of polysome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) with constant addition of liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) at 30℃ and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage (OD=0.5-0.6).

Cell lysates were clarified by two sequential centrifugation steps - 3000g, 5 minutes, 4℃, and 20000g, 10 minutes, 4℃. Part of the cell lysate was used for mRNA isolation using Oligo(dT) beads.  Another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to a linear 10-50% sucrose gradient in fractionation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) and separated on a SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 35000 rpm, 3 hours, 4℃. Subsequently, ribosome-bound RNA fragments were collected from the monosome fraction. Ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Kasari et al., 2019 DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkz600). Importantly, cycloheximide was added to the lysis buffer but not to the growth media.

Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10 with the following parameters for RNA-Seq (-a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --minimum-length 20 -q 20) and Ribo-Seq samples (-a CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --trimmed-only -q 20).
Additionally for Ribo-Seq, the reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1, and unique barcodes were then removed with cutadapt v. 2.10 (-q 20 --minimum-length 20 -u -4).
Afterwards, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequence set obtained from silva-euk and rfam databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3. Only unmapped non-rRNA reads were saved for the further analysis.
Read mapping and counting against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly was performed with STAR v. 2.7.9a.

Cells were collected by vacuum filtration, separated from the filter with a plastic scraper and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and ground with a pestle with addition of polysome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) with constant addition of liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) at 30℃ and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage (OD=0.5-0.6).

Cell lysates were clarified by two sequential centrifugation steps - 3000g, 5 minutes, 4℃, and 20000g, 10 minutes, 4℃. Part of the cell lysate was used for mRNA isolation using Oligo(dT) beads.  Another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to a linear 10-50% sucrose gradient in fractionation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) and separated on a SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 35000 rpm, 3 hours, 4℃. Subsequently, ribosome-bound RNA fragments were collected from the monosome fraction. Ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Kasari et al., 2019 DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkz600). Importantly, cycloheximide was added to the lysis buffer but not to the growth media.

Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10 with the following parameters for RNA-Seq (-a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --minimum-length 20 -q 20) and Ribo-Seq samples (-a CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --trimmed-only -q 20).
Additionally for Ribo-Seq, the reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1, and unique barcodes were then removed with cutadapt v. 2.10 (-q 20 --minimum-length 20 -u -4).
Afterwards, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequence set obtained from silva-euk and rfam databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3. Only unmapped non-rRNA reads were saved for the further analysis.
Read mapping and counting against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly was performed with STAR v. 2.7.9a.

Cell lysates were clarified by two sequential centrifugation steps - 3000g, 5 minutes, 4℃, and 20000g, 10 minutes, 4℃. Part of the cell lysate was used for mRNA isolation using Oligo(dT) beads.  Another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to a linear 10-50% sucrose gradient in fractionation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) and separated on a SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 35000 rpm, 3 hours, 4℃. Subsequently, ribosome-bound RNA fragments were collected from the monosome fraction. Ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Kasari et al., 2019 DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkz600). Importantly, cycloheximide was added to the lysis buffer but not to the growth media.

Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10 with the following parameters for RNA-Seq (-a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --minimum-length 20 -q 20) and Ribo-Seq samples (-a CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --trimmed-only -q 20).
Additionally for Ribo-Seq, the reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1, and unique barcodes were then removed with cutadapt v. 2.10 (-q 20 --minimum-length 20 -u -4).
Afterwards, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequence set obtained from silva-euk and rfam databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3. Only unmapped non-rRNA reads were saved for the further analysis.
Read mapping and counting against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly was performed with STAR v. 2.7.9a.

Part of the cell lysate was used for mRNA isolation using Oligo(dT) beads.  Another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to a linear 10-50% sucrose gradient in fractionation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton) and separated on a SW-41 rotor (Beckman) at 35000 rpm, 3 hours, 4℃. Subsequently, ribosome-bound RNA fragments were collected from the monosome fraction. Ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Kasari et al., 2019 DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkz600). Importantly, cycloheximide was added to the lysis buffer but not to the growth media.

    <Data-Processing>
Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10 with the following parameters for RNA-Seq (-a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --minimum-length 20 -q 20) and Ribo-Seq samples (-a CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC --trimmed-only -q 20).
Additionally for Ribo-Seq, the reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1, and unique barcodes were then removed with cutadapt v. 2.10 (-q 20 --minimum-length 20 -u -4).
Afterwards, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequence set obtained from silva-euk and rfam databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3. Only unmapped non-rRNA reads were saved for the further analysis.
Read mapping and counting against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly was performed with STAR v. 2.7.9a.

    <Title>RNA Sequencing and Ribosome profiling of GIR2 and PUB1 knockout yeast strains.</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE185286</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>34900236</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
We present ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data for the wild type BY4742 S. cerevisiae strain, and strains with the complete individual deletions of the GIR2 and PUB1 genes.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Yeast cells of 3 different S. cerevisiae strains, namely: wt, gir2Δ, pub1Δ were maintained in YPD media. The libraries were sequenced, resulting in 14 RNA-Seq and 12 Ribo-Seq data sets.
