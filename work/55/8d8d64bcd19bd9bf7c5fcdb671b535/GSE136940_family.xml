      <Growth-Protocol>
HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37C. Yeast cultures were grown to mid-exponential phase (optical density 600 [OD600], ~0.4–0.5) at 30C, 200 revolutions per minute in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD).

For HEK 293T cells, total RNA is extracted using phenol:chloroform method. For yeast, total RNA is extracted using the hot-acid-phenol method.
Ribosome-protected footprints were purified from monosome fractions by size selection and gel extraction. Following 3' dephosphorylation these fragments were subjected to adaptor ligation, RT, circularization and PCR amplification.

Ribosome profiling reads were processed by clipping the adapter sequence and trimming the 4 randomized nucleotides of the linker using the FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13.
Processed yeast reads were mapped to tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA; reads from human samples were mapped to rRNA using bowtie version 1.2.1.1.
Residual reads were uniquely mapped to non-dubious ORFs (hg38; SacCer3; C_albicans_SC5314_version_A22;Pombe_ASM294v2) extended by 18 nt into the UTRs.

For HEK 293T cells, total RNA is extracted using phenol:chloroform method. For yeast, total RNA is extracted using the hot-acid-phenol method.
Ribosome-protected footprints were purified from monosome fractions by size selection and gel extraction. Following 3' dephosphorylation these fragments were subjected to adaptor ligation, RT, circularization and PCR amplification.

Ribosome profiling reads were processed by clipping the adapter sequence and trimming the 4 randomized nucleotides of the linker using the FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13.
Processed yeast reads were mapped to tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA; reads from human samples were mapped to rRNA using bowtie version 1.2.1.1.
Residual reads were uniquely mapped to non-dubious ORFs (hg38; SacCer3; C_albicans_SC5314_version_A22;Pombe_ASM294v2) extended by 18 nt into the UTRs.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
For HEK 293T cells, total RNA is extracted using phenol:chloroform method. For yeast, total RNA is extracted using the hot-acid-phenol method.
Ribosome-protected footprints were purified from monosome fractions by size selection and gel extraction. Following 3' dephosphorylation these fragments were subjected to adaptor ligation, RT, circularization and PCR amplification.

Ribosome profiling reads were processed by clipping the adapter sequence and trimming the 4 randomized nucleotides of the linker using the FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13.
Processed yeast reads were mapped to tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA; reads from human samples were mapped to rRNA using bowtie version 1.2.1.1.
Residual reads were uniquely mapped to non-dubious ORFs (hg38; SacCer3; C_albicans_SC5314_version_A22;Pombe_ASM294v2) extended by 18 nt into the UTRs.

      <Growth-Protocol>
HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37C. Yeast cultures were grown to mid-exponential phase (optical density 600 [OD600], ~0.4–0.5) at 30C, 200 revolutions per minute in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD).

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
For HEK 293T cells, total RNA is extracted using phenol:chloroform method. For yeast, total RNA is extracted using the hot-acid-phenol method.
Ribosome-protected footprints were purified from monosome fractions by size selection and gel extraction. Following 3' dephosphorylation these fragments were subjected to adaptor ligation, RT, circularization and PCR amplification.

    <Data-Processing>
Library strategy: Ribo-Seq
Ribosome profiling reads were processed by clipping the adapter sequence and trimming the 4 randomized nucleotides of the linker using the FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13.
Processed yeast reads were mapped to tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA; reads from human samples were mapped to rRNA using bowtie version 1.2.1.1.
Residual reads were uniquely mapped to non-dubious ORFs (hg38; SacCer3; C_albicans_SC5314_version_A22;Pombe_ASM294v2) extended by 18 nt into the UTRs.

Ribosome profiling
processed data file: Pombe_supplementary_count_table.txt
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Library strategy: Ribo-Seq
Ribosome profiling reads were processed by clipping the adapter sequence and trimming the 4 randomized nucleotides of the linker using the FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13.
Processed yeast reads were mapped to tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA; reads from human samples were mapped to rRNA using bowtie version 1.2.1.1.
Residual reads were uniquely mapped to non-dubious ORFs (hg38; SacCer3; C_albicans_SC5314_version_A22;Pombe_ASM294v2) extended by 18 nt into the UTRs.
Genome_build: hg38 (GRCh38); SacCer3 (R64); C_albicans_SC5314_version_A22 (ASM18296v3); Pombe_ASM294v2 (ASM294v2)

    <Title>Humans and other commonly used model organisms are resistant to cycloheximide-mediated biases in ribosome profiling experiments</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE136940</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>34429433</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Ribosome profiling measures genome-wide translation dynamics at sub-codon resolution. Cycloheximide (CHX), a widely used translation inhibitor to arrest ribosomes in these experiments, has been shown to induce biases in yeast, questioning its use. However, whether such biases are present in datasets of other organisms including humans is unknown. Here we compare different CHX-treatment conditions in human cells and yeast in parallel experiments using an optimized protocol. We find that human ribosomes are not susceptible to conformational restrictions by CHX, nor does it distort gene-level measurements of ribosome occupancy, measured decoding speed or the translational ramp. Furthermore, CHX-induced codon-specific biases on ribosome occupancy are not detectable in human cells or other model organisms. This shows that reported biases of CHX are species-specific and that CHX does not affect the outcome of ribosome profiling experiments in most settings. Our findings provide a solid framework to conduct and analyze ribosome profiling experiments.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Comprehensive analysis of the effect of CHX on ribosome profiling experiments in different yeasts and mammalian cells. Libraries were generated with a highly standardized and optimized protocol to maximize comparability and to deduce CHX-specific biases.
