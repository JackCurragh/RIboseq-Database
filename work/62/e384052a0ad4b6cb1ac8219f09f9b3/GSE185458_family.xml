Cycloheximide was added to yeast media to final concentration 100µg/ml and growth was continued for 3 minutes then cells were harvested by filtration.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or SD (0,67% YNB w/o amino acids, 2% glucose) at 30C and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Cells were resuspended in polysome lysis bufer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100  g/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenyzed by grinding. Part of the cell lysates was used for mRNA isolation, another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to sucrose gradient fractionation with subsequent isolation of ribosome-bound RNA fragments from monosome fraction. mRNA was isolated using Oligo(dT) beads  and ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Ingolia NT et al., 2009, Science).
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10. 3’ adapter sequences for Ribo-Seq data: CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and RNA-Seq data: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC.
Ribo-Seq reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1 by unique barcodes indexes.
After barcode trimming, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequences taken from silva-euk [10.1093/nar/gks1219] and rfam [10.1093/nar/gkaa1047] databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3 [10.1038/nmeth.1923]. Only unmapped reads were saved for further analysis.
Read counting and mapping against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly were obtained with STAR v. 2.7.9a

Cycloheximide was added to yeast media to final concentration 100µg/ml and growth was continued for 3 minutes then cells were harvested by filtration.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or SD (0,67% YNB w/o amino acids, 2% glucose) at 30C and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage.

Cells were resuspended in polysome lysis bufer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100  g/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenyzed by grinding. Part of the cell lysates was used for mRNA isolation, another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to sucrose gradient fractionation with subsequent isolation of ribosome-bound RNA fragments from monosome fraction. mRNA was isolated using Oligo(dT) beads  and ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Ingolia NT et al., 2009, Science).

    <Data-Processing>
Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10. 3’ adapter sequences for Ribo-Seq data: CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and RNA-Seq data: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC.
Ribo-Seq reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1 by unique barcodes indexes.
After barcode trimming, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequences taken from silva-euk [10.1093/nar/gks1219] and rfam [10.1093/nar/gkaa1047] databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3 [10.1038/nmeth.1923]. Only unmapped reads were saved for further analysis.
Read counting and mapping against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly were obtained with STAR v. 2.7.9a

Cycloheximide was added to yeast media to final concentration 100µg/ml and growth was continued for 3 minutes then cells were harvested by filtration.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or SD (0,67% YNB w/o amino acids, 2% glucose) at 30C and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage.

Cells were resuspended in polysome lysis bufer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100  g/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenyzed by grinding. Part of the cell lysates was used for mRNA isolation, another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to sucrose gradient fractionation with subsequent isolation of ribosome-bound RNA fragments from monosome fraction. mRNA was isolated using Oligo(dT) beads  and ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Ingolia NT et al., 2009, Science).

    <Data-Processing>
Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10. 3’ adapter sequences for Ribo-Seq data: CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and RNA-Seq data: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC.
Ribo-Seq reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1 by unique barcodes indexes.
After barcode trimming, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequences taken from silva-euk [10.1093/nar/gks1219] and rfam [10.1093/nar/gkaa1047] databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3 [10.1038/nmeth.1923]. Only unmapped reads were saved for further analysis.
Read counting and mapping against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly were obtained with STAR v. 2.7.9a

Cycloheximide was added to yeast media to final concentration 100µg/ml and growth was continued for 3 minutes then cells were harvested by filtration.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or SD (0,67% YNB w/o amino acids, 2% glucose) at 30C and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage.

      <Molecule>polyA RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Cells were resuspended in polysome lysis bufer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100  g/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenyzed by grinding. Part of the cell lysates was used for mRNA isolation, another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to sucrose gradient fractionation with subsequent isolation of ribosome-bound RNA fragments from monosome fraction. mRNA was isolated using Oligo(dT) beads  and ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Ingolia NT et al., 2009, Science).

Library strategy: Ribo-seq
Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10. 3’ adapter sequences for Ribo-Seq data: CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and RNA-Seq data: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC.
Ribo-Seq reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1 by unique barcodes indexes.
After barcode trimming, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequences taken from silva-euk [10.1093/nar/gks1219] and rfam [10.1093/nar/gkaa1047] databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3 [10.1038/nmeth.1923]. Only unmapped reads were saved for further analysis.
Read counting and mapping against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly were obtained with STAR v. 2.7.9a

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cycloheximide was added to yeast media to final concentration 100µg/ml and growth was continued for 3 minutes then cells were harvested by filtration.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or SD (0,67% YNB w/o amino acids, 2% glucose) at 30C and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>polyA RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Cells were resuspended in polysome lysis bufer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100  g/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenyzed by grinding. Part of the cell lysates was used for mRNA isolation, another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to sucrose gradient fractionation with subsequent isolation of ribosome-bound RNA fragments from monosome fraction. mRNA was isolated using Oligo(dT) beads  and ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Ingolia NT et al., 2009, Science).

Library strategy: Ribo-seq
Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10. 3’ adapter sequences for Ribo-Seq data: CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and RNA-Seq data: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC.
Ribo-Seq reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1 by unique barcodes indexes.
After barcode trimming, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequences taken from silva-euk [10.1093/nar/gks1219] and rfam [10.1093/nar/gkaa1047] databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3 [10.1038/nmeth.1923]. Only unmapped reads were saved for further analysis.
Read counting and mapping against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly were obtained with STAR v. 2.7.9a

Cycloheximide was added to yeast media to final concentration 100µg/ml and growth was continued for 3 minutes then cells were harvested by filtration.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) or SD (0,67% YNB w/o amino acids, 2% glucose) at 30C and 220 rpm to exponential growth stage.

      <Molecule>polyA RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Cells were resuspended in polysome lysis bufer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100  g/ml cycloheximide, 1% Triton), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenyzed by grinding. Part of the cell lysates was used for mRNA isolation, another part was treated with ribonuclease I for polysome disassembly and applied to sucrose gradient fractionation with subsequent isolation of ribosome-bound RNA fragments from monosome fraction. mRNA was isolated using Oligo(dT) beads  and ribosome-bound RNA was isolated using acidic-phenol extraction.
cDNA libraries for Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq were constructed in parallel using standard ribosomal profiling library construction protocol (described in Ingolia NT et al., 2009, Science).

    <Data-Processing>
Library strategy: Ribo-seq
Reads were trimmed using cutadapt v. 2.10. 3’ adapter sequences for Ribo-Seq data: CTGTAGGCACCATCAATAGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and RNA-Seq data: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC.
Ribo-Seq reads were deduplicated with seqkit rmdup v. 0.10.1 by unique barcodes indexes.
After barcode trimming, reads were aligned against eukaryotic rRNA sequences taken from silva-euk [10.1093/nar/gks1219] and rfam [10.1093/nar/gkaa1047] databases using bowtie2 v. 1.2.3 [10.1038/nmeth.1923]. Only unmapped reads were saved for further analysis.
Read counting and mapping against the Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.95 (Ensembl) genome assembly were obtained with STAR v. 2.7.9a

    <Summary>
We present ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data for the wild type BY4742 S. cerevisiae strain, and strains with the complete individual deletions of the TMA46, STM1 and YGR054W genes.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Yeast cells of 4 different S. cerevisiae strains, namely: wt, tma46Δ, eif2aΔ, stm1Δ were maintained in YPD media. The libraries were sequenced, resulting in 16 RNA-Seq and 16 Ribo-Seq data sets.
