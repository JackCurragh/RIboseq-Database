GSM5281938,WT rep 1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,yeast,74D-694wild type,,polysome extraction,Inconclusive,NA,"the extraction is performed as previously published Baudin-Baillieu A et al. Methods Mol. Biol. 2016, 1361:105-24. briefly: Pellet cells by centrifugation at 4 °C, 4000×g for 10 min. resuspend pellet in 10 ml cold Lysis Buffer containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. Pulverize Cells by adding glass beads and vortexing the mix- ture for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove cells debris by centrifugation at 4 °C, 5000×g for 5 min and transfer the supernatant to chilled 1.5 ml microfuge tubes on ice. The supernatant is clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C, 15,000×g for 15 min. Recover supernatant. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the TruSeq Small RNA preparation kits",{},[],
