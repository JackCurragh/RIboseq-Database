Cells were scraped into a slurry, and then passed 10 times through a 26 G needle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20000 xg, 10 min, 4 °C). Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments were generated by adding 300 U RNase-I (Thermo Fisher, EN0601) for 45 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. For total RNAseq, sequencing libraries were constructed with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, E7420L) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For Riboseq sequencing library preparation, the RNA was first ligated to a 3’ adapter 4N-RA3 (see below), and gel-purified using a 15 % denaturing urea-PAGE gel (Carl Roth). Next the 5’ adapter OR5-4N (see below) was ligated and gel purified. The RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified by Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fischer, F-530XL).
