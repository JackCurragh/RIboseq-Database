    <Data-Processing>
Ribo-seq fastq files were stripped of the adapter sequences using cutadapt. UMI sequences were removed and reads were collapsed to fasta format. Reads shorter than 20 nt were removed. Reads were first aligned against rRNA (accession number U13369.1), and to a collection of snoRNAs, tRNAs and miRNA (retrieved using the UCSC table browser) using bowtie2 in the ‘local’ alignment mode.
Reads were mapped to the hg38 version of the genome (without scaffolds) using STAR 2.6.0a supplied with the GENCODE 32 .gtf file. The following parameter were used:--alignEndsType EndToEnd (Ribo-seq and PAR-CLIP) --outFilterMismatchNmax 2 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04 (Ribo-seq) --outFilterMismatchNmax 3 (PAR-CLIP and RNA-seq) --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outSAMmultNmax 1 --outMultimapperOrder Random (All)
De-novo splice junction discovery was disabled for all datasets.
Count matrices for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq were built using reads mapping uniquely to CDS regions of protein-coding genes, using the Bioconductor packages GenomicFeatures,  GenomicFiles and GenomicAlignments
Only reads mapping for more than 25nt were used. Genomic and transcript regions for TPM calculation were extracted using Ribo-seQC

Reads were first aligned against rRNA (accession number U13369.1), and to a collection of snoRNAs, tRNAs and miRNA (retrieved using the UCSC table browser) using bowtie2 in the ‘local’ alignment mode.
Reads were mapped to the hg38 version of the genome (without scaffolds) using STAR 2.6.0a supplied with the GENCODE 32 .gtf file. The following parameter were used:--alignEndsType EndToEnd (Ribo-seq and PAR-CLIP) --outFilterMismatchNmax 2 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04 (Ribo-seq) --outFilterMismatchNmax 3 (PAR-CLIP and RNA-seq) --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outSAMmultNmax 1 --outMultimapperOrder Random (All)
De-novo splice junction discovery was disabled for all datasets.
Count matrices for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq were built using reads mapping uniquely to CDS regions of protein-coding genes, using the Bioconductor packages GenomicFeatures,  GenomicFiles and GenomicAlignments
Only reads mapping for more than 25nt were used. Genomic and transcript regions for TPM calculation were extracted using Ribo-seQC

    <Data-Processing>
Ribo-seq fastq files were stripped of the adapter sequences using cutadapt. UMI sequences were removed and reads were collapsed to fasta format. Reads shorter than 20 nt were removed. Reads were first aligned against rRNA (accession number U13369.1), and to a collection of snoRNAs, tRNAs and miRNA (retrieved using the UCSC table browser) using bowtie2 in the ‘local’ alignment mode.
Reads were mapped to the hg38 version of the genome (without scaffolds) using STAR 2.6.0a supplied with the GENCODE 32 .gtf file. The following parameter were used:--alignEndsType EndToEnd (Ribo-seq and PAR-CLIP) --outFilterMismatchNmax 2 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04 (Ribo-seq) --outFilterMismatchNmax 3 (PAR-CLIP and RNA-seq) --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outSAMmultNmax 1 --outMultimapperOrder Random (All)
De-novo splice junction discovery was disabled for all datasets.
Count matrices for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq were built using reads mapping uniquely to CDS regions of protein-coding genes, using the Bioconductor packages GenomicFeatures,  GenomicFiles and GenomicAlignments
Only reads mapping for more than 25nt were used. Genomic and transcript regions for TPM calculation were extracted using Ribo-seQC

    <Data-Processing>
Ribo-seq fastq files were stripped of the adapter sequences using cutadapt. UMI sequences were removed and reads were collapsed to fasta format. Reads shorter than 20 nt were removed. Reads were first aligned against rRNA (accession number U13369.1), and to a collection of snoRNAs, tRNAs and miRNA (retrieved using the UCSC table browser) using bowtie2 in the ‘local’ alignment mode.
Reads were mapped to the hg38 version of the genome (without scaffolds) using STAR 2.6.0a supplied with the GENCODE 32 .gtf file. The following parameter were used:--alignEndsType EndToEnd (Ribo-seq and PAR-CLIP) --outFilterMismatchNmax 2 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04 (Ribo-seq) --outFilterMismatchNmax 3 (PAR-CLIP and RNA-seq) --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outSAMmultNmax 1 --outMultimapperOrder Random (All)
De-novo splice junction discovery was disabled for all datasets.
Count matrices for Ribo-seq and RNA-seq were built using reads mapping uniquely to CDS regions of protein-coding genes, using the Bioconductor packages GenomicFeatures,  GenomicFiles and GenomicAlignments
Only reads mapping for more than 25nt were used. Genomic and transcript regions for TPM calculation were extracted using Ribo-seQC

    <Title>Ribosome profiling in DDX3X degron cell lines and complementation with sex-linked paralogs</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE180669</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>34535544</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
We describe the subset of transcripts that require DDX3 for efficient translation and identify similarities and differences between X- and Y- linked paralogs of DDX3.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Ribosome profiling upon auxin-induced degradation of DDX3X, and covered with either DDX3X or DDX3Y was performed from HCT116 cells.
