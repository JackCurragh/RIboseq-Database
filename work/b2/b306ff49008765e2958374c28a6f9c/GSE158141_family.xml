    <Pubmed-ID>34615539</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Ribosome profiling in HEK293 cells with and without the depletion of CNOT1. This allows the determination of translational efficiency and nucleotide resolution of ribosome occupancy.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Ribosome profiling for HEK293 cells treated with either control of CNOT1-targeting siRNA for 48hrs, conducted for three biological replicates. Ribo-zero treated total RNA samples are also included. 
The control ribosome profiling data has also previously been used in Wilczynska et al. eIF4A2 drives repression of translation at initiation by Ccr4-Not through purine-rich motifs in the 5'UTR. Genome Biol 2019 Dec 2;20(1):262. PMID: 31791371 (GSE134517)
